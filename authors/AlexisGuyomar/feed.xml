      <title>A Fresh Start for PrestaShop Issues: Bringing Clarity to Chaos</title>

      <description>2,300 issues. One number. One challenge. Imagine searching for a needle in a haystack of 2,300 straws. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what PrestaShop contributors experience today when trying to check if their bug has already been reported. It&amp;rsquo;s also the daily challenge for our QA teams navigating this ocean of issues, some dating back to 2018.
This historical centralization in PrestaShop/PrestaShop made sense&amp;hellip; until it didn&amp;rsquo;t. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re changing course.
Our vision: every issue in its place, a place for every issue We&amp;rsquo;re opening issues directly in each repository that needs them (Core, Themes, Modules) so every repo tracks its own bugs.</description>

      <description>Let’s face it—our Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.
As part of the Seamless Upgrade &amp;amp; Extensibility squad, one of our key missions is to improve the reliability of PrestaShop upgrades. And to do that, we knew the Update Assistant module needed more than just a few patches—it needed a complete reinvention.</description>

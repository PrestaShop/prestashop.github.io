During the day, I was able to present a conference, titled “PrestaShop news - Where we are and where we’re going”.

          <description>The develop branch contains the source code that will give birth to PrestaShop 9. This is the future of PrestaShop: it will be released either at the end of the year 2023 or at the beginning of the year 2024 and must carry on the ambition of the project for 2024. This major version must also embrace the change in the PHP ecosystem, and consequently, it must drop the support of obsolete PHP versions.</description>

          <title>An update on the Symfony migration</title>
          <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2022/introducing-horizontal-migration/</link>

          <description>In December 2015, a groundbreaking change in PrestaShop was announced: the introduction of the Symfony framework into the CMS. The goal was to gradually replace PrestaShop’s custom framework with Symfony, and switch its templating system from Smarty to Twig. This project was known as “The Symfony migration”. Looking back, we realize that referring to this project as a “migration” wasn’t really accurate at all.</description>

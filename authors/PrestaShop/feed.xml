      <description>The PrestaShop cron service will be officially shut down in December 2025, marking the end of a legacy component that once helped stores without full server access automate scheduled tasks.
What is the PrestaShop cron service? This service was originally introduced to assist merchants on shared hosting environments that did not allow setting up native cron jobs. It worked together with the cronjobs module, sending periodic requests to execute scheduled actions such as currency rate updates or module maintenance routines.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop 8.2.3 is available. It is a security‑driven patch release for the 8.2 branch. Its primary goal is to address an email enumeration vulnerability in the back office password reset feature. A handful of low-risk improvements and bug fixes that have already been validated have also been included.
Why this release now? PrestaShop 8.2 is in the extended support phase, so only security and critical fixes are shipped. Over the past days, we observed (via community reports and partners) automated probes abusing the back office password reset page to enumerate employee emails.</description>

      <title>SQL Injection attacks alert and security enhancements for PrestaShop</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/sql-injection-attacks-alert-and-security-enhancements-for-prestashop/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/sql-injection-attacks-alert-and-security-enhancements-for-prestashop/</guid>
      <description>A recent wave of attacks has targeted PrestaShop stores, leveraging SQL Injection vulnerabilities in third-party modules to compromise data security. Malicious actors exploit these vulnerabilities to inject harmful code into the PrestaShop database, enabling the theft of sensitive customer information by loading unauthorized JavaScript scripts.
According to the investigation, this vulnerability is not in the PrestaShop core but in third-party modules. Stores using a custom database prefix and without SQL Injection-vulnerable modules installed should remain unaffected.</description>

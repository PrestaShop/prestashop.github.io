      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary/</guid>
      <description>During this yearâ€™s FoP Days, we launched a new community initiative focused on improving a specific part of the PrestaShop project: hooks. Rather than casting a wide net, we deliberately concentrated on a single topic. The goal was to make it easier and faster for contributors to submit changes, and for project members to validate them.
Why hooks? Hooks are essential for extending and customizing PrestaShop without overriding core files. They empower developers to build features in a clean, future-proof way.</description>

Security: PrestaShop 8.2.3 A security-driven patch release for PrestaShop 8.2 is out. Version 8.2.3 fixes an email enumeration vulnerability on the back office password reset page. While PrestaShop 9 is not affected, we strongly recommend updating if you are on the 8.</description>

      <description>From its very first release, PrestaShop has been built and improved thanks to the dedication of its open source community. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new way to celebrate that dedication - directly in your back office.
The Wall of Fame is a new tab in the back office available through the ps_distributionapiclient (version 1.2.0) module that showcases the top companies and individuals contributing to PrestaShop. Merchants can now see, right where they manage their store, the vibrant community making the software better every day.</description>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary/</guid>
      <description>During this yearâ€™s FoP Days, we launched a new community initiative focused on improving a specific part of the PrestaShop project: hooks. Rather than casting a wide net, we deliberately concentrated on a single topic. The goal was to make it easier and faster for contributors to submit changes, and for project members to validate them.
Why hooks? Hooks are essential for extending and customizing PrestaShop without overriding core files. They empower developers to build features in a clean, future-proof way.</description>

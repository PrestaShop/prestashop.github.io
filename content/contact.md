### Getting support

Whether it's getting started, understanding product features, setting up your shop or knowing the best practices, there are many reasons why you might need support as a merchant.

Here are a few ways to get answers to your questions:

* [Official User Documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/welcome/) - Comprehensive guides and tutorials
* [Community support on forums](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/)
* [Community support on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/discussions)
* [Paid support plans](https://care-center.prestashop.com/gb/)
* [Training courses](https://care-center.prestashop.com/gb/56-prestashop-training)


### Contacting our teams

#### Reporting issues to the Core team

No software is perfect, and PrestaShop is no exception. Our team spends its whole time creating features, testing behaviors and fixing bugs: it's a year-long process.

We'd love to have you on the team! Join the ranks of users who help to improve PrestaShop: provide us with a detailed report of any reproducible issue you stumble upon, and we'll do our best to get it fixed!

Please use [this reference guide](https://www.prestashop-project.org/get-involved/report-issues/) to better understand what makes a great Github issue.

Then, create your report for the right context. The Core team will review your report and answer back with any questions and /or ideas.

* [PrestaShop's GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues)

Thank you for your contribution and support to the PrestaShop community!

We also have [a Slack chat](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/) for you to join, where you can chat with other contributors, and where the team sometimes hangs out :)


#### Talking to the PrestaShop Marketplace team

Do you need help with a purchased module or theme from the Marketplace? The best way to get your message through is to contact the original developer through the [Marketplace contact form](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/contact-us).

If the developer does not answer in a timely fashion, let us know, [using the same form](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/contact-us).

### Contributing

PrestaShop is Open Source, and has a great marketplace for creative members of the community: two big reasons for you to contribute!

By helping with the Core code, you build significant knowledge with the codebase, and a strong relationship with the team.

By selling your modules/themes on the Marketplace, you can earn money for your development, and gain exposure for your work. Thanks to that you also support the project financially, as PrestaShop takes a small commission on each sale.

What's not to like? :)

#### To the Core

Core contributors are expected to know the PrestaShop technologies and tools in order to best contribute:

* PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Smarty, etc.
* Git and GitHub
* Our [coding standards](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/development/coding-standards/)
* Our [commit convention](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/contribute/contribution-guidelines/)

Got everything set up? Find the branch you want to work with:

* [Current development branch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop) (for the next version).

#### To Translations

If you find that a section of the software (or its native modules) is badly translated, you can help by suggesting a new translation for your language!

All the community translation work happens on [the Crowdin platform](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official). Create an account, and you can start your translations right away!

If you found a text string that is simply not translatable, you can create a GitHub issue (see above), or email the team: translation@prestashop.com.

#### To Documentation

**User documentation:** Read the [official User Documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/welcome/) for comprehensive guides. The documentation has dozens of chapters and hundreds of pages of content. If you spot typos or areas that need updates, send us an email at documentation@prestashop.com. The documentation site is also a wiki, so you can fix issues directly! Contact the team at documentation@prestashop.com for an account.

**Developer/Designer documentation:** Check the [technical documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/) for themes, modules, and development guides. The techdocs are generated from static text files. You can contribute through [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues) by creating issues or pull requests. Thank you!

#### To the Marketplace catalog

The Marketplace has thousands of contributions from the community - and you can sell there too! [Read the guide here](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/content/25-how-to-sell-on-prestashop-addons).

If you have any questions, [contact the Marketplace team](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/contact-us).

#### To the Build devblog

The "Build" is a blog written by project members, which presents news and helpful information for people who contribute to the PrestaShop project.

While most of the articles are written by our team, we welcome contributions! [Read the guide here](https://build.prestashop-project.org/about/#contribute).

Contributions are made through [a specific GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop.github.io).
Would you like us to write about a specific topic? Write to the team with your idea: build@prestashop.com.

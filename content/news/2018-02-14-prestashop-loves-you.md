Obviously. We met in 2007, united by two passions: e-commerce and open source. We got to know each other, shared some laughs, often dreamt together—with some groans thrown in—while continuing to love each other. Together, we created with the goal of meeting the e-commerce needs of each country.

Thanks to our union and our shared energy, hundreds of thousands of successful e-commerce stories have come to be and continue to be told today. We are e-merchants, developers, friends, agencies, freelancers, idealists, entrepreneurs, partners, employees, perfectionists... We are the PrestaShop community. Each day, it is a joy and an honor to work hand-in-hand with each and every one of you. Together, we make up 1.3 million today!

**Thank you from the bottom of our hearts** for everything we have been through over the past 10 years. Due your contributions and commitment, we’ve been able to experience and watch wonderful stories unfold and look forward to many more fantastic adventures to come!


Let us continue together to make PrestaShop successful and prosperous by contributing in the development of future versions, which will be used throughout the world every day.

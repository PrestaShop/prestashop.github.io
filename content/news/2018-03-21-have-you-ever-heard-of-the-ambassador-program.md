As you might already know, PrestaShop’s biggest strength is that it has one of the largest open source communities regarding ecommerce in the world. Hand in hand with all its contributors, PrestaShop provides a software that enables everyone, everywhere in the world, to build a successful online store.

Among other things, you can ask questions or help people on the forum, contribute on GitHub, or join a meetup near you. PrestaShop is **one company with its global community**. And talking about meetups, have you ever heard of the Ambassador Program?


## Achievements of the Program

In order to get closer and to maintain a **strong relationship with its community**, PrestaShop launched the Ambassador Program in 2013. This has been done through a wide variety of community-building activities, such as organizing meetups or webinars. In average each year, **more than 150 PrestaShop Meetups are organized** on every continent!

And today **more than 50 countries** are involved with **more than 95 voices** dedicated locally to our community all around the world. 

Thanks to the Program, the community often gathers and has numerous possibilities to **share experiences and knowledge** about PrestaShop and ecommerce. It is also a good moment to get **constructive feedbacks from the community** which is part of empowering the PrestaShop software.

Our volunteer Ambassadors drive activities that **raise local awareness and educate our community about ecommerce**. They are consultants, web designers, developers, merchants, etc.

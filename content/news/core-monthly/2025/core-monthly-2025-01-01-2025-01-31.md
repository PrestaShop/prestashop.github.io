### PrestaShop 9.0 Beta

January 2025 was all about pushing PrestaShop 9.0 closer to its Beta release. In the `9.0.x` branch, we focused on refining the back office and core, with several targeted fixes and improvements. Changes include better help text and form behavior in the back office, fixes for carrier configurations on the new, migrated version of this page. We will be sharing more details about the upcoming Beta release soon, so stay tuned!

**Notable changes in PrestaShop 9, developer documentation**

It's a good time to start exploring the new features and improvements in PrestaShop 9.0. The developer documentation has been updated with some of the latest changes, including new features, breaking changes and things you have to know before upgrading your module or theme. You can find the updated documentation on the [PrestaShop Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/modules/core-updates/9.0/).

### PrestaShop 8.2.1

The next patch for PrestaShop 8.2 is in the works. In January, in the `8.2.x` branch, we have been working on fixing issues in the back office, core, and tests. The latest changes include improvements to the order details page, search functionality, and multistore disabling. We also updated dependencies and fixed performance issues related to the `HookModuleFilter`. The patch is expected to be released in February, so keep an eye out for the official announcement.

### Auto Upgrade module

The Auto Upgrade module has received several updates in January. The latest changes include improvements to the backup configuration, page updates, and error handling. We also introduced a new middleware system and updated the UI for the module. The team is working on enhancing the user experience and performance of the Auto Upgrade module. Version 7 of the module will be dedicated to upgrading to PrestaShop 9.0, so make sure to follow the progress of this project.

### Live Update - January 2025

During the January 2025 Live Update, we provided insights into the upcoming PrestaShop 9 Beta 1 and announced the next patch for 8.2. In addition, we introduced the "Targeted Contributions" experiment aimed at streamlining community involvement. The session also presented ongoing enhancements to the multi-carrier feature, a project led by the Software Components Squad from PrestaShop SA. You can watch the Live Update full recording on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JljSmYH-vdg).

**Targeted Contributions**

The "Targeted Contributions" experiment is designed to simplify the process of contributing to the PrestaShop project. The goal is to provide contributors with a clear path to getting involved and making meaningful contributions. The experiment will focus on specific areas of the project, starting with a focus on hooks contributions. You can read more about the experiment and how to get involved in the [dedicated discussion](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/discussions/37703) on GitHub.

### Summary

In summary, January 2025 has been a busy month for the PrestaShop project to start the year strong. The continuous improvements on the `9.0.x` branch, crucial stability fixes in the `8.2.x` branch, and notable advancements in our modules all contribute to a stronger, more reliable platform. The Live Updates are a great opportunity to meet the people behind new features in PrestaShop and to get a glimpse of what the future holds for the software. We are excited to see what February will bring and look forward to sharing more updates with you soon!

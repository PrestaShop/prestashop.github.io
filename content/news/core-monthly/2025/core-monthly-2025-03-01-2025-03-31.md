Stay up to date with the latest developments in the PrestaShop project by reading the Core Monthly. This edition covers the most important news, updates, and changes in the project for March 2025. Let's dive in!

### PrestaShop 9.0 is coming soon!

After the release of the Beta version for PrestaShop 9.0, project members are working hard to prepare the first Release Candidate. The goal is to release it in a few weeks. 

This new major release will include many new features and improvements, but also some breaking changes. As part of our efforts to keep you informed and help you adapt to the new version, we will be releasing a series of blog posts that will cover the most important changes and new features in PrestaShop 9.0. The first one has already been published, and it covers removal of Guzzle HTTP client from the core and how to deal with it. You can read it [here]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/breaking-change-guzzle-removal-v9">}}).

Another important information is the update of [Example Modules](https://github.com/PrestaShop/example-modules) to make them compatible with PrestaShop 9.0. Most of the modules have been adjusted and their new versions are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/example-modules). Watch out: module examples for PrestaShop 8 and 9 are now available in separate branches. The `8.x` branch contains the modules compatible with PrestaShop 8, while the `master` branch contains the modules compatible with the latest version of PrestaShop.

Analyzing changes in these modules can help you understand how to adapt your own modules to the new version. During the March Live Update I shared some recommendations on how to prepare for the required work. You can watch the recording of the Live Update [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PL0dwdRiho&t=6s&ab_channel=PrestaShopProject).

Make sure to check our blog regularly for more updates on the new version of PrestaShop and the changes it brings.

### Release of the Update Assistant module

The Update Assistant module has been completely revamped and is now available for PrestaShop 1.7 and later versions! This new release marks a significant milestone, as it replaces the Auto Upgrade module with a modern, more efficient solution. To learn more about the key changes and enhancements introduced in this version, check out the detailed article [here]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/autoupgrade-v7.0-release.md" >}}). We are excited to see how this update will improve the upgrade experience for the PrestaShop community!

### Call for contributions - Hooks

As announced in [this discussion](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/discussions/37703) and during FOP Days, we’re continuing an experiment to streamline the validation process for contributions. The focus will be on adding new hooks, as they are simple to implement, enhance extensibility by reducing overrides, and can be included in patch releases, delivering quick value to merchants.

To support this initiative, the [documentation on hook contributions](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/contribute/contribute-pull-requests/add_hook/) has been updated, and maintainers will prioritize reviewing these PRs. This time-limited test aims to release approved hooks in the upcoming minor version 8.2.X. While resources for reviews remain limited, we’re committed to improving the process and making this a success.

### Live Update - March 2025

The March Live Update took place on March 5, 2025. During this session, we discussed the latest developments in the PrestaShop project, including the release of the PrestaShop 8.2.1 version and the upcoming PrestaShop 9.0.  We also shared some tips on how to prepare for the new version and answered questions from the community. On top of that, we presented plans for the improved user journey for discounts creation in PrestaShop 9.1.0. This new feature will make it easier for merchants to create and manage discounts in their stores, improving the overall user experience.

You can read the summary of the Live Update [here]({{< relref "/news/public-oss-demo/2025/live-update-march-2025" >}}) and watch the recording on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PL0dwdRiho&ab_channel=PrestaShopProject).

### FOP Days 2025

The 2025 Friends of Presta (FOP) Days wrapped up on March 26-27 at Le Nida in Issy-les-Moulineaux. This two-day event brought together developers, agencies, and ecommerce professionals from the PrestaShop community for discussions, technical insights, and networking. Discover the highlights in the [dedicated article]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/fop-days-2025" >}}).

### Summary

March 2025 was another productive month for the PrestaShop project. The team made significant progress in preparing the next major release of PrestaShop and launched the new version of the Update Assistant module. The community's active participation in discussions and contributions was truly great to see. With the upcoming release of PrestaShop 9.0, we are excited to see how these changes will benefit the community and improve the overall experience for merchants and developers alike.

### PrestaShop 9.0.0 is out! ðŸŽ‰

Month of June is first and foremost a month of the release of PrestaShop 9.0.0, which is now available for download!

This release is a major milestone for the PrestaShop project, as it brings a lot of new features and improvements. We hope you will enjoy it as much as we do. You can find more information about the release in the [release notes]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-9-0-available" >}}).

We also created a dedicated landing page for the release, which you can find [here](https://www.prestashop-project.org/releases/prestashop90/).

### Call for contributions: Hooks

June was also the last month of our call for contributions related to hooks, which was launched earlier this year. The goal of this call was to improve the hooks system in PrestaShop, and to encourage contributors to create new hooks or improve existing ones.

**We are happy to announce that we achieved our goal of 10 merged contributions!**

You can find a dedicated post about this call [here]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary" >}}) and see the list of merged contributions, as well as agencies and contributors who participated in this call.

**Thank you** to all the contributors! We are looking forward to seeing more contributions in the future, and we hope that this call will inspire you to contribute to PrestaShop in other areas as well.

The next call for contributions will be launched in the coming weeks, so stay tuned! 

### Contributor interviews

I want to also share with you a new interview with a contributor, which was published in June. This time, we talked with Dominik Shaim Ulrich, [@ShaiMagal](https://github.com/ShaiMagal), who is a long-time contributor to the PrestaShop project. He shared his experience with contributing to PrestaShop, the reasons why he contributes, and his thoughts on the project. You can read the interview [here]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/Dominik-Shaim-Ulrich-contributing-locally" >}}).

For those who have not read the previous interview with [@Codencode](https://github.com/Codencode), you can find it [here]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/codencode-agency-contributor-interview" >}}). Paolo from Codencode shared some amazing insights about his experience with contributing to PrestaShop, and how his agency is involved in the project.

We want to continue this series of interviews, so if you are a contributor and would like to share your experience with the project, or you know someone who would be a great candidate for an interview, please let me know!

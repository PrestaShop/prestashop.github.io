We are back with the July edition of the PrestaShop Core Monthly! ðŸŒž

![Core Monthly banner](/assets/images/theme/banner-core-monthly-wide.jpg)

Dear community,

July has been an exciting month for the PrestaShop project, filled with significant releases, upcoming feature announcements, and continued community engagement. Let's dive into what made this summer month particularly productive for our project.

### PrestaShop 8.2.2 maintenance release

We released [PrestaShop 8.2.2]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-2-2-maintenance-release" >}}) on July 28th, bringing a comprehensive set of bug fixes and improvements to the 8.2.x branch. This patch version includes numerous enhancements across the back office, front office, core, installer, and web services.

As highlighted in our recent communications, **PrestaShop 8.2.x has now entered the extended support phase**, meaning it will only receive security patches and critical updates going forward. We encourage merchants to start planning their migration to PrestaShop 9 to benefit from the latest features and ongoing improvements.

Read more about this release in the [PrestaShop 8.2.2 release notes]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-2-2-maintenance-release" >}}).

### July Live Update: A glimpse into the future

On July 30th, we hosted our July Live Update session, which was packed with exciting announcements and updates. The highlight of the session was the **announcement of the One Page Checkout (OPC) feature coming in PrestaShop 9.1**. This highly anticipated feature will streamline the checkout experience for customers and provide merchants with a more modern, conversion-optimized solution.

We also covered several other important topics during the session:
- Progress updates on Hummingbird 2 theme development
- Announcement of the upcoming PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025
- Conclusion of our successful Call for Contributions: Hooks campaign
- Introduction of the new Call for Contributions focused on Admin API

You can read more about the Live Update session in our [dedicated post]({{< relref "/news/public-oss-demo/2025/live-update-july-2025" >}}) and watch the replay on YouTube.

### Looking ahead: Admin API Call for Contributions

Following the success of our hooks-focused call for contributions (which achieved its goal of 10 merged contributions!), we're preparing to launch a new initiative centered around the Admin API. This represents an exciting opportunity for developers to contribute to one of PrestaShop 9's most significant new features.

We will be sharing more details about this initiative in the coming days, including how you can get involved and contribute to shaping the future of PrestaShop.

### Developer Conference 2025

We're thrilled to announce that the PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025 is in the works! The call for speakers is now open, and we're looking forward to bringing together the PrestaShop community for another inspiring event focused on technical innovation and best practices.

If you are an expert in PrestaShop development, have insights to share, or want to showcase your work, we encourage you to submit your proposal. The conference will be a fantastic opportunity to connect with fellow developers, learn from industry leaders, and contribute to the future of PrestaShop.

### Development highlights: What's cooking in the codebase

July was a particularly productive month for development across all PrestaShop branches. Here are some key development highlights:

**PrestaShop 9.1 Features (develop branch)**
The develop branch saw significant progress on upcoming features for PrestaShop 9.1, with major work on:
- **Enhanced discount system**: Multiple contributions improving cart rules functionality, including new product-specific conditions, combination selection capabilities, and brand-based triggers
- **Multi-shipment functionality**: A comprehensive set of commands and queries for handling split shipments, including merge, split, and delete operations
- **Improved testing coverage**: Extensive functional tests for cart rules and discount functionality

**PrestaShop 9.0.x Improvements**
The 9.0.x branch received important refinements and bug fixes:
- **Admin API enhancements**: Multiple improvements to API pagination, filtering, and error handling
- **UI/UX improvements**: Better styling for notifications, date pickers, and carrier management
- **Performance optimizations**: Enhanced cart performance and image handling improvements
- **Developer experience**: Better error messages and debugging capabilities

### Summary

July has shown us the dynamic evolution of the PrestaShop ecosystem, from maintenance releases ensuring stability for current users to exciting new features that will shape the future of e-commerce.

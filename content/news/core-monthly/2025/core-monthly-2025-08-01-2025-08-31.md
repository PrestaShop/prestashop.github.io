Welcome to the August edition of Core Monthly. This month brought an important security patch for 8.2, a new community feature in the back office, and a fresh call for contributions to expand the Admin API in PrestaShop 9.

![Core Monthly banner](/assets/images/theme/banner-core-monthly-wide.jpg)

### Security: PrestaShop 8.2.3

A security-driven patch release for PrestaShop 8.2 is out. Version 8.2.3 fixes an email enumeration vulnerability on the back office password reset page. While **PrestaShop 9 is not affected**, we strongly recommend updating if you are on the 8.2.x branch. For full details, including workarounds and manual patch instructions, check out the [security release announcement]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-2-3-security-release" >}}).

### Community: Wall of Fame lands in the back office

Have you seen the new "Wall of Fame" in your back office? It’s a new page that celebrates the amazing people and companies who contribute to PrestaShop. Now, every merchant can see the faces and names behind the project, right from their admin panel. It’s our way of saying thank you and showing the world who powers PrestaShop. Curious how to get your name or company on the list? [Find out in the full announcement]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/meet-prestashop-wall-of-fame" >}}).

### Call for contributions: Let's build the Admin API together

Remember our first call for contributions on hooks? It was a huge success! Now, it’s time for round two. During FoP Days, you voted for the Admin API as a top priority, and we listened. PrestaShop 9 comes with a solid foundation for a new Admin API, but it needs more endpoints to be truly useful for the ecosystem. This is where you come in. Let's work together to build the API you need. We’ve prepared the documentation and are ready to help on Slack. [Join the effort!]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-admin-api" >}})

### Other notable changes

Besides these big topics, August was busy with other improvements. We saw many fixes in the back office, including for translation exports and the enhanced flexibility of TinyMCE editor. The core received updates to its Symfony components and better error handling. The `8.2.x` branch also got its share of maintenance work. For a full picture, check the detailed list of pull requests below. A big thank you to everyone who contributed!

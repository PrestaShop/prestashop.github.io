Welcome to the September edition of the Core Monthly! This month was buzzing with activity around PrestaShop 9, with the team working on its first patch release and the community stepping up to expand the new Admin API. We also saw some fantastic new tools and improvements, all thanks to dedicated contributors.

### PrestaShop 9: patch in progress and Admin API Call for Contributions

September has been a busy month for the project. The team is working on the first patch for PrestaShop 9, which should address key issues reported by the PrestaShop QA team and the community. We are grateful for all the feedback we have received so far, and we are doing our best to make PrestaShop 9 better.

At the same time, the ["Call for Contributions"]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-admin-api" >}}) for the Admin API has been a great success. We are thrilled to see so many of you getting involved and contributing to the PrestaShop API's future.

The [first pull requests have already been merged](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_apiresources/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+label%3A%22Admin+API+Contributions%22), and we will share a summary of the first month in the coming days.

Special mention to [@Progi1984](https://github.com/Progi1984) and [@Codencode](https://github.com/Codencode) for contributing the first merged endpoints, including those for `Tab`, `Zone`, `WebserviceKey`, and `categories`.

A big thank you to everyone who has contributed so far!

### Security: PrestaShop 8.2.3

While the team is focusing on PrestaShop 9, we also shipped a security patch for the 8.2 branch. PrestaShop 8.2.3 (released on September 4th, 2025) fixes an email enumeration vulnerability in the back office password reset flow and includes a few validated bug fixes. If you run an `8.2.x` shop, please update as soon as possible - full details and manual patch instructions are available in the security release notes: [PrestaShop 8.2.3 is available]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-2-3-security-release" >}}).

### Community spotlight: new CLI tools and performance boosts

This month, we want to give a special shout-out to a few contributors for their significant improvements. First, to [@iNem0o](https://github.com/iNem0o), who added two great features to PrestaShop: a CLI command to [regenerate thumbnails](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/39478) (`prestashop:thumbnails:regenerate`) and another one for [search indexation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/39403) (`prestashop:search:indexation`). These tools will make developers' lives easier. We also want to thank [@MattKelvin](https://github.com/MattKelvin) for his work on [improving cart performance](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32058), which will benefit all stores with many combinations.

### Other project news

**Multi-carrier feature on `develop`**

Work on the `develop` branch (PrestaShop 9.1) is heavily focused on the upcoming multi-carrier feature. This feature adds the ability to split shipments from a single order, manage them in the order details page, and edit shipment details, laying the groundwork for more flexible logistics management in future versions of PrestaShop.

**Hummingbird v2**

The work on [Hummingbird 2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/hummingbird/tree/improvements) continues at a strong pace, with a significant focus on accessibility. As seen in recent pull requests, the team, including [@mattgoud](https://github.com/mattgoud), [@tblivet](https://github.com/tblivet), and [@ga-devfront](https://github.com/ga-devfront), is making extensive improvements across the entire user journey.

This includes enhancements to the homepage, category and product pages, the checkout process, customer account pages, and modules like faceted search and the contact form, ensuring the new theme is compliant with accessibility standards.

**Developer documentation**

The [developer documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs) has also received a lot of improvements thanks to [@PrestaEdit](https://github.com/PrestaEdit), [@Prestaworks](https://github.com/Prestaworks), [@MattKelvin](https://github.com/MattKelvin), and [@Touxten](https://github.com/Touxten).

**Update Assistant module**

Version 7.4.1 of the [Update Assistant](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) module is ready for the upcoming PrestaShop 9.0.1.

### PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025: the agenda is coming!

A quick update on the [PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025](https://events.prestashop.com/content/developer-conference). The call for speakers is now closed, and we have selected the speakers. The full agenda will be shared in October, and registration has already opened. Seats are limited, so secure your spot now on the [event's website](https://events.prestashop.com/e/prestashop-developer-conference-2025/en). We can't wait to see you there!

### Summary

September 2025 was a busy month in the PrestaShop Project, with significant progress on various things, including the upcoming PrestaShop 9.0.1 release, ongoing work on the Hummingbird theme and Admin API. I'm very happy to see increased community involvement, across endpoints contributions, documentation improvements, and new features.

Let's keep the momentum going into October!

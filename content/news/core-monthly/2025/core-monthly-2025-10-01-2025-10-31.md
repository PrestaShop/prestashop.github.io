October has been an exceptional month for the PrestaShop project! We released the first maintenance version of PrestaShop 9, opened registration for our biggest community event of the year, and watched the Admin API contribution initiative gain incredible momentum. Let's dive into what made this month so special.

October was truly a milestone month for PrestaShop. The energy and enthusiasm from both PrestaShop SA and our community contributors have been remarkable, resulting in impressive progress across multiple fronts.

## PrestaShop 9.0.1 is here, 9.0.2 is coming soon

The [first patch version for PrestaShop 9]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-9-0-1-maintenance-release" >}}) arrived on October 13th, bringing over 60 bug fixes and 140 merged pull requests. Since its release, PrestaShop 9 has been met with great enthusiasm from our community, and this maintenance release focuses on resolving key issues that directly impact day-to-day operations. A primary focus was placed on addressing challenges encountered during the installation process on some environments, ensuring a smoother and more reliable deployment experience for everyone.

But we're not stopping there. Work is already in progress on PrestaShop 9.0.2, which is planned for release in November. The team is actively collecting feedback and fixing additional issues to make PrestaShop 9 even more stable and reliable.

## Admin API contributions are flying

Remember our [Call for Contributions focused on Admin API]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-admin-api" >}})? The response has been phenomenal! After the success of our first Call for Contributions focused on hooks, we invited the community to help expand PrestaShop 9's new Admin API with additional endpoints. October saw incredible progress, with community members stepping up to contribute new endpoints across multiple domains.

The numbers speak for themselves. We've seen a steady stream of contributions adding endpoints for categories, attributes, stores, suppliers, tax rules, titles, search aliases, addresses, and more. You can track the [current coverage of endpoints](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/39630) to see what's been accomplished and what's still available to work on.

If you haven't joined yet, it's not too late! Head over to the `#cfc-adminapi` channel on [PrestaShop Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/) to get started and see what endpoints you'd like to contribute.

## Big improvements to the developer experience

October brought a significant enhancement to the developer experience, thanks to [@tyloo](https://github.com/tyloo). The [Docker setup integrated in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/39305) received a complete rework with comprehensive documentation. This isn't just a small tweak – it's a fundamental improvement that makes it easier for developers to get started with PrestaShop development. The new setup includes better configuration options, clearer documentation, and a more streamlined workflow. If you're developing for PrestaShop, you'll definitely want to check out these improvements.

We also want to give a big shout-out to [@MattKelvin](https://github.com/MattKelvin) for his amazing work on [the developer documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org). Over recent weeks, he's made numerous contributions that have significantly improved the quality and accessibility of our documentation. Thanks to contributors like Matt, it's easier than ever for developers to learn and build with PrestaShop.

## Progress on key features for PrestaShop 9.1

On the development side, October saw solid progress on two major features for PrestaShop's future. The multi-carrier functionality continued to evolve with multiple pull requests adding virtual product filters, split shipment improvements, and better order summary displays. Meanwhile, the discounts feature received substantial attention with work on the priority system, form improvements, and new validation rules. Both of these features are shaping up to bring significant value to merchants.

Work on Hummingbird 2.0 also continues at a steady pace, with [@tblivet](https://github.com/tblivet) leading the charge on making PrestaShop's front office accessible, faster and more modern.

## A truly collaborative month

What makes October stand out is the balance of contributions from both PrestaShop SA and our community members. From bug fixes and new features to documentation improvements and API endpoints, everyone played a part in moving the project forward. This is what open source is all about – people from different backgrounds and companies coming together to build something great.

Beyond these major topics, October was packed with other improvements. You'll find detailed lists of all the pull requests and changes below, covering everything from back office enhancements and front office fixes to core improvements and test coverage. The sheer volume of work accomplished this month is impressive, with 408 pull requests opened and 313 merged across the project repositories.

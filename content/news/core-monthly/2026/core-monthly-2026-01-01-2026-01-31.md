We welcomed 2026 with a lot of exciting news and progress across the PrestaShop ecosystem. Read on for a recap of the biggest highlights from January, including the release of PrestaShop 9.1 Beta, deep dives into the new multi-carrier and discounts features, and the first videos from our Developer Conference 2025.

Happy New Year! January was a great way to start 2026: we opened the PrestaShop 9.1 Beta for community testing, shared deep dives into two major changes (Shipments and the improved Discounts system), and continued publishing the video recaps from the PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025.

### PrestaShop 9.1 Beta: time to test what's next

[![PrestaShop 9.1 Beta banner](/assets/images/2026/01/PrestaShop-9.1.0-Beta1-BuildBlog.png)]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-9-1-beta1" >}})

If you've been waiting for a good moment to try the next minor version of PrestaShop, this was it. We released the first beta of 9.1 and, more importantly, asked for feedback early so we can polish things before the stable release. You can explore the changes, and tell us what works (and what doesn't): [PrestaShop 9.1 Beta is open for feedback!]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-9-1-beta1" >}}).

This beta is also a nice checkpoint for front-office developers. 9.1 is where [Hummingbird v2]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/hummingbird-v2-beta" >}}) becomes the new default theme, bringing a modern stack, strong performance, and a big focus on accessibility.

### Shipping without the “one order = one carrier” headache

[![Shipments feature preview banner](/assets/images/2026/01/Improved_shipments_feature_flag.png)]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/introducing-shipments" >}})

One of the biggest changes in 9.1 is the move from a carrier-centric model to a shipment-centric one. This is not a small refactor: it's a structural improvement that finally makes multi-carrier scenarios clearer for merchants and less confusing for customers. It also opens the door to future features like more advanced fulfillment flows (and it does it safely, behind a feature flag): [Introducing Shipments in PrestaShop]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/introducing-shipments" >}}).

### Discounts rebuilt for clarity (and performance)

		</a>
	</div>
</div>

Discounts are another area where we chose to rebuild instead of patch. The new system in 9.1 makes discount rules easier to understand and aims to avoid the messy edge cases that appear when many cart rules start interacting. It's also a step toward better performance in day-to-day catalog operations, again introduced behind a feature flag so you can test it progressively: [Improved Discounts System in PrestaShop 9.1]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/improved-discounts-system" >}}).

### Developer Conference 2025: videos and takeaways

[![PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025 banner](/assets/images/2025/12/MainstageDevcon.jpg)]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/prestashop-developer-conference-2025-keynote-sessions" >}})

We also continued Developer Conference 2025 recap series. If you couldn't attend live (or want to rewatch the key moments), you can start with the [opening sessions and Q&A]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/prestashop-developer-conference-2025-keynote-sessions" >}}) and then pick the topics you care about most, like [modern development practices]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/developer-conference-2025-filmed-modern-development-architecture" >}}), [AI and productivity]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/developer-conference-2025-film-AI-productivity" >}}), or [developer enablement and growth]({{< relref "/news/posts/2026/prestashop-developer-conference-2025-developer-enablement-and-growth" >}}). All recordings are also available as a playlist on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vavpAx3MdY&list=PLyZYn1MMU7-zV2l3LNEQh78Fjp83ip_Da).

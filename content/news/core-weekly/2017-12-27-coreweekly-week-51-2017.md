## General messages

Dear all, the PrestaShop team is happy to wish you a great, beautiful and fun Christmas time! As the holidays are coming, we would like to thank you once again for having made PrestaShop headway so much in 2017. One small step for each of you, one giant leap for the community!

Also, we are very glad to announce our QA Manager, @mbadrani, submitted a [pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/8633) a few days ago which consists of a test suite that will help validating features of the software. Mostly, it targets the non-regression of the core ones. It should be the starting point for automatizing tests, first for the QA team but also, we hope so, for the contributors next. What a huge saving of time it would be, right?

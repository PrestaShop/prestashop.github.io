## General messages

Hi there! Can you feel it in the air? It seems to be a perfect time for an expected release... indeed, PrestaShop 1.7.3.0 RC1 has been released last week - with almost 200 pull requests in it! Since the beta, we've fixed many of bugs and added a last-minute feature: new demo products.

And since one good thing leads to many others, we also released a security patch on the 1.7.2 branch. It fixes two security vulnerabilities - one of them critical - so we wanted to make sure that all merchants would be able to quickly and safely secure their shops without having to wait for final 1.7.3.0 which is due... this week, so get ready!

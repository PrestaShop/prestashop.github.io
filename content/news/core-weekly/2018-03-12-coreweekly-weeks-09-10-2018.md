## General messages

Wow, almost seventeen pull requests merged last week. Impressive! It seems that we’re back, with a lot of features and futures projects to share, and it feels very good. A [test framework]( http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-test-framework) has been set, to launch a suite of functional tests and gain precious time, [version 1.7.3.0]( http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-3-0-available) is out, the [release schedule]( http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/2018-release-schedule) also, and the detailed roadmap is on its way… we are pretty eager to be on the road again with you all! Stay connected!

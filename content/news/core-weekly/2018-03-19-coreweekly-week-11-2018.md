## General messages

Hi beloved community, hope you're all fine there! We were pretty focused on your contribution lately, with both Crowdin [monthly report](http://build.prestashop.com/news/do-you-speak-prestashop-february-2018) and interview of [Šarūnas Jonušas](http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-interview-sarunas-jonusas) who has been helping us a lot with the Symfony migration. Good job everybody, thanks a million! Regarding this week, as we did for the [Integration Fund](http://build.prestashop.com/news/integration-fund-is-still-alive) last month, we will let you know about how to involve deeper and, if you want, become one of our great ambassadors... and, highlight of the show, our detailed roadmap for this year. Don't miss it, keep reading the devblog. ;-)

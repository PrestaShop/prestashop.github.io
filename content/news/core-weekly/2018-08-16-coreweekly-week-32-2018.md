## General messages

Hello dear PrestaShop enthusiasts!

In the middle of August a lot of people are off for Summer holidays, doing something else than coding: it means less code reviews and less pull requests. However if you look carefully, you will see that the current work is now focused on 1.7.5. Some good news: the Google Sitemap module is coming back!.

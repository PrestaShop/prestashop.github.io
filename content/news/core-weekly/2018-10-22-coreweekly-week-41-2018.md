## General messages

Dear Developers,

A network maintenance will be operated on our infrastructure during the night of Monday 22nd to Tuesday 23rd of October. The PrestaShop Addons Maketplace and its APIs will be unavailable between 0:00 and 0:30 CET, hence a 30 minutes of downtime.
The aim of this operation is to increase the company servers' network bandwidth, in order to be able to cope with the continuous growth of PrestaShop online stores in the world.

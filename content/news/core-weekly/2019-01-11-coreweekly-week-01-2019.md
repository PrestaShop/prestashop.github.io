## General messages

Dear Developers,

First week of 2019 is a good start with 31 merged pull requests. But now that everybody is back, let's continue to contribute like the best weeks of 2018, and aim at minimum 40 pull request merged per week. That would be great! And remember, a small pull request, solving one problem, is easier to review and to merge than a very big one with changes in a lot of files and/or about many issues.

Since the beginning of the year, I have improved the first section of the core-weekly, with new figures about the PrestaShop project repositories on GitHub. In a few week, with a bit of history to show, I will try to share a chart so we can look at the trends.

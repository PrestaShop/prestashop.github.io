## General messages

Dear Developers,

There is a lot of things going on this week !

The first one is obviously about PrestaShop 1.7.6.3 being available. This maintenance release fixes 16 issues reported on versions 1.7.6.0, 1.7.6.1 and 1.7.6.2. Please [read the release note](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-6-3-maintenance-release/) for more informations.

Secondly, we have created the `1.7.7.x` branch which will carry the changes being released with 1.7.7.0. So from now on, the work carried out on `develop` branch will be released with 1.7.8.

Finally, after asking you what was your opinion about [no longer committing generated files](https://build.prestashop.com/news/open-question-not-commiting-assets-anymore/) and receiving positive feedback for the change, we have implemented it into the [develop branch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/16670). We have also [updated the developer documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pull/418) accordingly in order to provide developers with all the necessary information to be able to generate these files on their own.

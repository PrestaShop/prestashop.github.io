## General messages

Happy new year to you, dear contributors and community members! Contributors and maintainers slowly come back from time off and activity increases back on the GitHub repositories.

During December holidays, QA team tested the 1.7.7.1 candidate release and reported some issues of this build. Only one is significant enough to prevent the release from happening: [an issue preventing upgrade from PrestaShop 1.6 to PrestaShop 1.7.7](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/22668). The scope of the release has been updated accordingly.

Once this bug is fixed, the road should be open for [1.7.7.1 public release](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/22306#issuecomment-754737943)!

Another notice: following increased performance issues on our current CI pipeline, we are slowly migrating our CI to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). We had previously explored GitHub Actions capacities on modules to validate it as a suitable solution and we are now moving into the next phase.

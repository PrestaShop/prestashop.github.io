## General messages

Dear developers,

We enter the month of March, and this is the last month before April when we expect the feature freeze to happen!

Multiple projects for 1.7.8 have delivered major milestones last week:

[Virtual product files](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/23386) are now managed in the new Product Page being built, as well as improvements for handling [suppliers for product with combinations](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/23284).

The Back Office maintenance page is now [the first Symfony Back Office page using the new Multistore checkboxes interface](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/22379) to manage multistore settings.

We also would like to applause the merge of PR [#20288](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/20288) which is the Back Office page "Customers > Outstanding" migrated to Symfony by contributor [@ks129](https://github.com/ks129)!

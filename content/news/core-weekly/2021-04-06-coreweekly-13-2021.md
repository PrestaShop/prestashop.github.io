## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week was filled with lot of interesting events!

First, [PrestaShop 1.7.7.3](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-3-maintenance-release/) was released on the 30st of March, 2021. This maintenance release fixes 10 bugs reported on previous 1.7.7 versions, as well as one security issue.

On the 31st of March, the maintainers team held again a video conferencing for the project public demonstrations session, streamed live on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/UJ_XQs8trs4).

Two achievements were presented:
- 1.7.8 Feature Flags by [@matks](http://github.com/matks)
- Backlog cleaning by [@hibatallahAouadni](http://github.com/hibatallahAouadni)

A complete summary of the session will soon be published.

Another repository was granted a security maintenance release: [ps_emailsubscription v2.6.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_emailsubscription/releases/tag/v2.6.1).

Finally, we have entered the month of April which is the month where PrestaShop 1.7.8 should be [feature frozen](https://build.prestashop.com/news/ps17-minor-release-lifecycle/#feature-freeze). The very last Pull Requests are being submitted and validated so we can complete the 1.7.8 milestone. Needless to say, maintainers are very busy at this moment! :muscle:

## General messages

Dear developers,

We would like to remind you about the upcoming Public Demo for the open source project, scheduled for [October 5th, 2022, at 4 PM](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/upcoming-demo-7-2022/). As we wrote in the article, this time, we plan to host a Q&A session with questions you can ask not only during the event, but also beforehand. All you have to do is fill [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfF1s80LqSCCZiC1kzht7XqQMwTilwRJU2H9EzIteMkWUDWIQ/viewform) with your questions.

Last week @FabienPapet [joined the project's committers](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/issues/121). Also, maintainers concluded the vote for @PrestaEdit's application to join their team and [decided to reject it](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/issues/106#issuecomment-1260894066).

In other news, Hacktoberfest has started! [Read more about this year's edition](https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/hacktoberfest-2022/).

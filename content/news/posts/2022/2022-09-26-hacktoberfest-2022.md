With the month of October coming in a few days, be prepared for Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open source software. The online event has been happening every October for the last 9 years and is sponsored by the American cloud hosting company [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com). How can you participate? Very simple: people are encouraged to create at least 4 pull requests for open source projects on GitHub.

If you are not sure how to get involved in open source projects and where to start, Hacktoberfest might be the perfect opportunity.

## Getting involved and contributor prizes

Your goal is to contribute with at least 4 quality pull requests to the open source project you like. DigitalOcean will send every contributor achieving this goal prizes, including a t-shirt or a tree planted in your name and a set of unique stickers.

Everyone is welcome, especially beginners. New for this year are [low or non code contributions](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code), so no matter what your experience, you can participate in Hacktoberfest. Just find the open source projects you want to be involved in and start contributing! It is a simple process:

:wave: Register for Hacktoberfest first, [right here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register).

:computer: Create pull requests to get involved in your favorite projects - they must have a public GitHub repository.

:white_check_mark: Make sure your pull requests will be validated by Hacktoberfest: [check the rules](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#pr-mr-details).

:bulb: Remember to let the open source project know you are participating in the event. You can put information in your Pull Request's description.

:busts_in_silhouette: Wait for the project maintainers to review your contributions.

:repeat: Go through this same process to achieve the goal of 4 pull requests!

During [this event](https://www.ow2.org/view/webinar/webinar_2), PrestaShop will be presenting alongside ALLMA, a project based on the /e/OS fork of Android and integrating the best of open source modern LLMs. The project is sponsored by a European fund, NGI Search. Pierre-Yves Gibello, OW2’s CEO, will be introducing the webinar at the beginning of the event. 

This is the second webinar of a [new series](https://www.ow2.org/view/webinar/), with online events occurring quarterly. Focus is on open source innovations, OW2 initiatives and the broader community. It also explores topics such as open science, funding opportunities, and other open source subjects. 

During his presentation, Clément Désiles, Engineering Manager at PrestaShop, will be shortly introducing the project as well as the company. Clément will then be explaining his professional projects, including CloudSync, which is currently used by PrestaShop and a new open source project, currently being evaluated. The presentation will show how the projects are evolving over time.

Also, what exactly is OW2? 
The OW2 Foundation is an independent, non-profit community organization dedicated to promoting open source software. The foundation helps PrestaShop with the development of our open source project, through online tools, events and communication.

The event will be held online on Thursday, September 26, 2024. You can find more information about the webinar and register through the event’s page.

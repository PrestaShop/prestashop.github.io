After the success of our first [Call for Contributions focused on hooks]({{< relref "/news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary" >}}), it's time to launch a new round. This time, we're inviting the community to contribute to one of the most significant changes in PrestaShop 9: the **new Admin API**.

### Why the Admin API?

During FoP Days, we asked attendees to vote on future contribution topics. Three stood out: Hooks, Admin API, and Web Accessibility ([EAA](https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/policies/justice-and-fundamental-rights/disability/union-equality-strategy-rights-persons-disabilities-2021-2030/european-accessibility-act_en)). We started with Hooks, work on the EAA subject will be part of Hummingbird 2, led by PrestaShop S.A., so now it’s time to focus on the Admin API, another top community choice.

The new Admin API introduced in PrestaShop 9 lays a solid foundation, but we need help expanding it with additional endpoints so that it can be fully integrated into the ecosystem. That's where you come in! This is your opportunity to help shape the future of the platform.

### What's this initiative about?

Our goal is to encourage the community to **contribute new Admin API endpoints** in PrestaShop 9.

To make things easier:

- We've created a [developer documentation for the new Admin API](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/admin-api/) and the documentation on [how to contribute a new endpoint](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/admin-api/contribute-to-core-api/).
- We've launched a dedicated `#cfc-adminapi` channel on the [PrestaShop Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/) to help you get answers quickly.
- Contributions will be labeled `Admin API Contribution` to ensure visibility.
- The initiative will be promoted on GitHub, the Build blog, and on social media to drive visibility.

Project members will begin reviewing contributions for the Admin API initiative in **September 2025**, with the goal of completing it by the end of 2025. These new contributions will be integrated into the `ps_apiresources` module, making all endpoints available for PrestaShop 9.0 and 9.1.

- [List of existing endpoints](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/admin-api/swagger-doc/)

### What kind of endpoints are needed?

The current Admin API covers a number of core entities, but many others are still missing. By contributing an endpoint, you'll be helping the ecosystem transition away from web services toward a solid, standardized integration layer.

You can [check what's missing](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/admin-api/swagger-doc/) and propose what you'd like to work on in the new Slack channel or by [opening a draft PR](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_apiresources/pulls).

### What's next?

✅ Join the [PrestaShop Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/) and to the `#cfc-adminapi` channel

✅ Explore the existing Admin API docs

✅ Get familiar with the API Platform if you haven't already

✅ Think about which endpoints you would love to see added

Let's work together to build a robust Admin API that benefits the entire ecosystem.

**We start reviewing contributions in September, so now's the perfect time to get started.**

Stay tuned for updates, and join the conversation on `#cfc-adminapi` Slack channel.

We can't wait to see what you'll create!

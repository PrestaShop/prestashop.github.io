The 2025 edition of [Friends of Presta (FOP) Days](https://friendsofpresta.org/friends-of-presta-day-fop-day/) has come to an end, leaving behind two days of discussions, technical insights, and networking. Held on March 26-27 at Le Nida in Issy-les-Moulineaux, the event brought together developers, agencies, and ecommerce professionals from the PrestaShop community.

### Collaboration and improving expertise

Organized by Friends of Presta, a French non-profit association in the PrestaShop ecosystem, this event was all about collaboration and innovation. From technical workshops to business strategy talks, attendees had the opportunity to exchange ideas, improve their expertise, and contribute to the future of open source ecommerce.

### Networking and community growth

Beyond the scheduled sessions, the FOP Days provided many opportunities for informal meetups and networking. Participants from different backgrounds exchanged ideas and built connections that will lead to future projects.

### Notable talks from the PrestaShop SA team

Among the many presentations given during the two days, PrestaShop spoke during two sessions. The first one was a talk by Agathe Aumont from PrestaShop, titled "Towards Safer Personalization", exploring strategies for making personalization more secure, with a Q&A session to answer the participants’ questions. 

The second session was with Paule Morizot and Sarah Dib of PrestaShop, who also delivered an inspiring presentation titled "Call for Contributions - Join the PrestaShop Movement!", proposing to developers to actively participate in shaping PrestaShop’s future through open source contributions.

### What’s next?

As the FOP Days 2025 ended, the momentum and ideas exchanged over the two days will continue to drive the PrestaShop community forward. Discussions are already continuing within the Friends of Presta Slack group, and the connections made at the event will no doubt lead to new collaborations.

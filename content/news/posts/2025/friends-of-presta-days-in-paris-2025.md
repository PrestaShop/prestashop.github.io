The Friends of Presta (FOP) Days is an event for PrestaShop and open source ecommerce enthusiasts. Taking place on March 26-27, 2025, at Le Nida, Issy-les-Moulineaux, in the Paris region, this event is dedicated to open source collaboration, technical innovation, and business insights dedicated to the PrestaShop community. You will be able to meet other professionals, exchange ideas, and contribute to the future of the community.

### Friends of Presta and the PrestaShop ecosystem

This event is organized by Friends of Presta, which is a French non-profit and brings together developers, integrators and agencies, among other types of members. Founded in 2021, Friends of Presta has become an important network of technical experts in the PrestaShop ecosystem. The association operates independently, working collaboratively on various projects, including security advisories, module and theme development, and organizing major events like the FOP Days. With many members and a growing Slack community exceeding 1000 participants, Friends of Presta brings a culture of open source collaboration and mutual support among PrestaShop professionals.

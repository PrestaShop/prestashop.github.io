On November 19, 2025, the PrestaShop developer community convened in Paris, and online via a global livestream, for the third PrestaShop Developer Conference. The program featured hands-on sessions, live demonstrations, and expert talks, alongside a major announcement. Attendees deepened their understanding of the PrestaShop ecosystem, gained project information, and explored practical advancements they can apply in their daily work.

### Highlights from a day of insightful sessions on the Main Stage 

Throughout the day, the Main Stage featured expert-led talks from the PrestaShop community, unveiling a major announcement regarding MCP and also sessions regarding AI, PrestaShop Enterprise, PrestaShop Core, deployment, Hummingbird and call for contributions. Sessions focused on real-world techniques to help developers expand their skill sets and deliver more impactful projects with PrestaShop.

The conference opened Wednesday morning with a welcome address from Olivier Binet, PrestaShop’s Managing Director and Alexandre Sarti, Head of Data at PrestaShop. Serving as Main Stage host, Alexandre introduced speakers and shared context and insights throughout the day.

Following Olivier’s and Alexandre’s speech, Olivier Fontenelle, PrestaShop’s Chief Technology Officer, and Clément Paillasse, PrestaShop’s Chief Product Officer, came to the main stage.

During Clément’s and Olivier’s session, participants were welcomed, given an overview of the event’s themes, and introduced to the event’s big announcement: MCP, which is Model Context Protocol, an open source standard. MCP provides structured access to information to be used as context by AI.

The PrestaShop MCP Server was then introduced. Then, Stephan Obadia, CEO of PrestaModule & BusinessTech, as well as Yoan Ballesteros, Developer at PrestaModule & BusinessTech, took the stage to give some real-world examples of its use.

Following the MCP announcement, Emmanuel Pays, Head of Solution Engineering Partnerships at PayPal, and Philippe Daly, PayPal’s Country Manager for France, took the stage to explore how AI agents are reshaping payments and shopping. Their talk was rich in insights, providing a wider vision on payments within the ecommerce ecosystem. After this session, Julien Bonvarlet, Engineering Manager at Core Engine at PrestaShop, explored AI and productivity, measuring the real impact of code assistants.
Then, Gautier Boudeweel, Senior Engineering Manager at PrestaShop as well as Soukaïna Barramou, Product Manager PrestaShop Enterprise at PrestaShop, covered PrestaShop Enterprise and a new developer experience.
At that point, a well‑deserved lunch break began and doubled as a great networking moment.

### Tech Room highlights

The Tech Room was the event’s second stage, where attendees followed a slate of advanced, hands-on presentations. Serving as Tech Room host, I welcomed presenters and introduced each session. 
Compared to the Main Stage, it featured an interactive cadence of shorter sessions, allowing attendees to dive into specialized topics ranging from cybersecurity to automated testing.

The more focused sessions let participants dive into diverse development topics and leave with practical, new techniques. The dual‑track format improved the experience by helping each attendee customize the day to their interests and goals.

### Afternoon sessions and DevCon Branch && Run winners announcement

The day featured more than 18 presentations delivered by 28 speakers, many of whom traveled long distances - including from South America - to join us in the Paris region and discuss PrestaShop. We won’t recap every session here. Look for session posts on the Build blog in the coming weeks, with recordings linked—stay tuned.

In the afternoon, the Main Stage hosted other exciting presentations!

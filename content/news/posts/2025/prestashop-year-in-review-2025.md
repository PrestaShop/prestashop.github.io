As 2025 comes to a close, it's time to reflect on an incredible year for the PrestaShop project. From the highly anticipated release of PrestaShop 9 to the vibrant gatherings at FOP Days and the Developer Conference, this year has been defined by innovation, collaboration, and the unwavering dedication of our community.

We’ve seen major technical advancements, new contribution initiatives, and a renewed focus on developer experience. Let’s take a month-by-month journey through the milestones that shaped 2025.

## January: Kicking off with knowledge sharing

The year started with a focus on learning, transparency, and security. We issued an important [alert regarding SQL injection attacks]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/sql-injection-attacks-alert-and-security-enhancements-for-prestashop.md" >}}), reinforcing our commitment to keeping the ecosystem safe.

We also recapped the [automated testing presentation from PSDevCon 2024]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/testing-and-analyzing-your-prestashop-modules-automatically.md" >}}), sharing valuable insights on how to analyze and test modules automatically.

We also held our first [Live Update of the year]({{< relref "news/public-oss-demo/2025/live-update-january-2025.md" >}}), keeping the community informed about the project's progress right from the start. During this session, we announced the launch of the [**Targeted Contributions** experiment](https://youtu.be/JljSmYH-vdg?t=222), a precursor to our structured Call for Contributions, aiming to streamline how the community can help improve the project.

Additionally, the Software Components Squad presented the improved [**multi-carrier feature**](https://youtu.be/JljSmYH-vdg?t=775), showcasing a significant enhancement for logistics and shipping management in PrestaShop.

## February: Preparing for the next major version

February was a pivotal month as we unveiled the [PrestaShop 9.0 Beta]({{< relref "news/releases/prestashop-9-0-beta-release.md" >}}). This gave developers their first hands-on experience with the upgraded technology stack - including Symfony 6.4 and PHP 8.4 support - and the new Admin API, setting the stage for the major release later in the year.

We also continued to support the 8.2 branch with the release of [PrestaShop 8.2.1]({{< relref "news/releases/prestashop-8-2-1-maintenance-release.md" >}}), ensuring stability for existing shops.

## March: Major tools and community events

March was a month of significant releases and gatherings. We launched the **Update Assistant module v7.0.0** (formerly 1-Click Upgrade), a complete rewrite featuring a new UI and CLI to make upgrades smoother and more reliable. We shared the [story behind this rework]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/reworking-the-update-assistant-module-v7-our-experience.md" >}}) and announced the [official release]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/autoupgrade-v7.0-release.md" >}}).

The community also gathered in Paris for **FOP Days 2025** (March 26-27). Organized by Friends of Presta, this event is always a highlight, fostering connections and sharing knowledge within the ecosystem. We published a [wrap-up of the event]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/fop-days-2025.md" >}}) in April.

We also hosted the [March Live Update]({{< relref "news/public-oss-demo/2025/live-update-march-2025.md" >}}), focusing on PrestaShop 9 Beta 1 and upcoming features in 9.1. To help developers prepare for v9, we published a guide on [adapting to the removal of Guzzle]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/breaking-change-guzzle-removal-v9.md" >}}).

## April: Keeping the momentum

Following the excitement of March, we hosted the [April Live Update]({{< relref "news/public-oss-demo/2025/live-update-april-2025.md" >}}). This session provided a deeper dive into the **Update Assistant module**, with a presentation of its new features and future roadmap. We also shared updates on the **Targeted Contributions** initiative, highlighting opportunities for the community to get involved in high-impact projects.

We also published an insightful [interview with Codencode]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/codencode-agency-contributor-interview.md" >}}), discussing their approach to sustainable contribution and their journey with PrestaShop.

To round out the month, we shared a recap of the [cybersecurity presentation from PSDevCon 2024]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/PSDevCon2024-Cybersecurity-presentation.md" >}}), reminding everyone that security is a shared responsibility.

## May: The calm before the storm

May was a quieter month on the public front, but behind the scenes, the core team and community were hard at work. The focus was entirely on polishing **PrestaShop 9.0**, fixing bugs reported during the beta phase, and preparing for the major launch.

## June: PrestaShop 9 arrives!

June marked the biggest milestone of the year: **PrestaShop 9.0 was officially released!**

![PrestaShop 9 is available!](/assets/images/2025/06/PS901535x425.png)

[PrestaShop 9]({{< relref "news/releases/prestashop-9-0-available.md" >}}) introduced a modernized architecture with Symfony 6.4, PHP 8.4 support, a brand-new Admin API, and significant performance improvements. It represented a major leap forward for the platform, offering a solid foundation for the future of ecommerce.

To support this release, we updated the documentation with a comprehensive guide on [Notable Changes](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/9/modules/core-updates/9.0/), essential for developers adapting their modules and themes. We also highlighted the new features and technical details on the [PrestaShop Project website](https://www.prestashop-project.org/releases/prestashop90/).

In the spirit of community, we also shared an inspiring [interview with Dominik Shaim Ulrich]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/Dominik-Shaim-Ulrich-contributing-locally.md" >}}), highlighting how local businesses contribute to the global project.

## July: Extended support and new initiatives

In July, we announced that [PrestaShop 8.2.x entered its extended support phase]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/82x-extended-support-phase.md" >}}), clarifying the roadmap for merchants and agencies.

We also published the [summary of the Call for Contributions focused on hooks]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary.md" >}}). This initiative, launched during FOP Days, resulted in many merged contributions from agencies and individuals like **OpenServis.cz**, **Creabilis**, **Griiv**, **Gurkcity**, **Arkonsoft**, **Evolutive**, **Pliciweb**, **Kiwik**, **@unlocomqx**, and **@Hlavtox**.

The month wrapped up with a feature-packed [Live Update]({{< relref "news/public-oss-demo/2025/live-update-july-2025.md" >}}). We unveiled the  **One Page Checkout (OPC)** feature for future versions of PrestaShop 9, shared progress on **Hummingbird 2**, and announced the **PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025**. We also released [PrestaShop 8.2.2]({{< relref "news/releases/prestashop-8-2-2-maintenance-release.md" >}}).

## August: Celebrating contributors and API progress

August was all about the people and the tech. Building on the success of the hooks initiative, we launched a new [Call for Contributions for the Admin API]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-admin-api.md" >}}). This campaign is a key part of our strategy to decouple the back office and improve developer experience, and we were thrilled to see the community's enthusiasm to participate once again.

We also took a moment to celebrate our top contributors with the launch of the [PrestaShop Wall of Fame]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/meet-prestashop-wall-of-fame.md" >}}).

This new feature, available directly in the back office, showcases the individuals and companies who power the project. It's a small way to say a big thank you to those who dedicate their time and expertise to making PrestaShop better for everyone.

## September & October: Security and stability

Security remains a top priority. In September, we released [PrestaShop 8.2.3]({{< relref "news/releases/prestashop-8-2-3-security-release.md" >}}) to address security issues.

October saw the first maintenance release for the new major version, [PrestaShop 9.0.1]({{< relref "news/releases/prestashop-9-0-1-maintenance-release.md" >}}). This release was a testament to the community's engagement, incorporating over **60 bug fixes** and **140 pull requests**. The feedback and contributions from developers, agencies, and merchants have been invaluable in refining PrestaShop 9, ensuring a smoother experience for everyone.

## November: A new era for themes and developer conference

November was a busy month! We gathered in Paris for the [PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/prestashop-developer-conference-2025-event-recap.md" >}}).

![Opening Keynote at DevCon](/assets/images/2025/12/OpeningKeynoteDevcon.jpg)

The event was packed with announcements, including the introduction of the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server for PrestaShop, which opens up new possibilities for AI-assisted development.

The Tech Room sessions provided deep dives into technical topics, fostering learning and exchange among developers.

November also brought exciting news for frontend developers with the announcement of the [Hummingbird v2.0.0 Beta]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/hummingbird-v2-beta.md" >}}).

![Hummingbird v2.0.0 Beta](/assets/images/2025/11/banner-hummingbird-v2-beta.png)

This new version of the theme, built with Bootstrap 5 and a modern stack, is set to become the default in PrestaShop 9.1. It represents a massive effort to provide a developer-centric, performant, and accessible theme foundation.

We also shared a [progress update on the Admin API Call for Contributions]({{< relref "news/posts/2025/call-for-contributions-admin-api-progress.md" >}}), showing the community's strong engagement in building the future of PrestaShop's integration layer.

## December: Connecting and Looking Ahead

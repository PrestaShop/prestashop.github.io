### Why attend the conference?

The PrestaShop Developer Conference is more than just a day of talks, it’s a hub for passionate developers to connect, collaborate, and learn from leading voices in the PrestaShop community.

This year, the PrestaShop Developer Conference will take place in a hybrid format. Join us in Paris for the full experience or tune in online. Following virtually will give you access to the main room conferences via live broadcast, while attending on-site will unlock the full program, including interactive workshops and the unique opportunity to connect face-to-face with other developers.

The 2025 edition will also feature:
* Live technical sessions that go deep into PrestaShop’s ecosystem
* Hands-on demos showcasing the latest tools and best practices
* Presentations about module and theme development, with techniques to boost both functionality and design
* Exclusive previews of what’s next for PrestaShop, giving you the insights you need to build better and utilize your store’s full potential

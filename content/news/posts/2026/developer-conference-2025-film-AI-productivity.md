The third PrestaShop Developer Conference took place in November 2025: two weeks ago, we started publishing a series of blog posts diving into the event's sessions, sharing insights and key takeaways with you. Last week, we spotlighted modern development practices and architectural approaches. This week, we're continuing the series with a focus on artificial intelligence and productivity. 

If you missed the event or want to revisit the key moments, we've made all sessions available on PrestaShop's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vavpAx3MdY&list=PLyZYn1MMU7-zV2l3LNEQh78Fjp83ip_Da).

From unlocking the agentic power of your store to measuring the real impact of AI code assistants, this week's sessions cover artificial intelligence in PrestaShop development. Let's dive into the key takeaways from each session—click any image below to watch the full video.

## Unlocking the agentic power of your store

The subject of this talk was the event’s big announcement: MCP, which is Model Context Protocol, a new open standard designed to connect language models (LLMs) to external data and actions in a secure and structured way. The session featured four presenters from two organizations. BusinessTech & PrestaModule was represented by Yoan Ballesteros, Developer, and Stephan Obadia, CEO. From PrestaShop came Jonathan Renard, Fullstack Developer, and Benoît Houdayer, Software Engineer.

In this presentation, we explore how MCP can be integrated with PrestaShop and used to expose real business logic: finding products, updating orders, checking stock levels, or generating reports.

This presentation explores how to leverage MCP to extend PrestaShop's modular architecture, implement secure AI agent integrations, and build your own LLM connectors. The talk is designed for PrestaShop developers and tech-savvy merchants looking to future-proof their stores with AI capabilities and next-generation ecommerce automation.

## AI and productivity: measuring the real impact of code assistants

In this video, Julien Bonvarlet is Engineering Manager at Core Engine, PrestaShop. This presentation explores how AI-powered coding assistants like Copilot, Cursor, and Claude are reshaping software development workflows. But what value do they actually deliver to development teams?

This session dives into practical applications of these tools: generating boilerplate, refactoring legacy code, writing tests, producing documentation, and streamlining migrations. Through live demonstrations, you'll discover how AI assistants reduce cognitive overhead and free developers to concentrate on solving business problems instead of repetitive coding tasks.

We'll also address the challenges: dependency risks, code quality considerations, and data confidentiality issues. The talk concludes with actionable strategies for integrating AI tools into open source projects like PrestaShop, including establishing usage guidelines, building reusable prompts, and tracking measurable productivity improvements. AI won't replace developers, but it's becoming an essential accelerator for development teams.

## PrestaShop 8 technical audit with ChatGPT and Gemini

In this presentation, Valeria Assetskaya, Ecommerce Coordinator at BelVG, shows conference attendees how to run a PrestaShop 8 technical audit focused on speed and security using ChatGPT and Gemini. Accessible to both merchants and developers, the method covers 12 core elements and requires neither site access nor coding expertise.

## How AI agents will redefine payments and shopping

In this presentation by our Platinum sponsor PayPal, Emmanuel Pays, Head of Partner Solution Engineering, PayPal and Philippe Daly, Country Manager, GM France, PayPal, explore how AI agents are transforming payments and online shopping experiences.

PayPal's Agentic Commerce Service enables AI-powered shopping directly within conversational platforms by converting product catalogs into shoppable APIs that handle discovery, recommendations, and one-click checkout. This creates a new commerce channel where shoppers can complete purchases without leaving chat interfaces.

AI is transforming both how we build ecommerce platforms and how customers shop. From coding assistants that accelerate development to agentic commerce services that enable purchases within conversations, these technologies are reshaping the ecommerce ecosystem. The challenge for developers is clear: adopt AI tools responsibly, integrate new commerce channels thoughtfully, and build stores ready for an AI-driven future. The tools are available, the standards are emerging, now it's up to us to build with them.

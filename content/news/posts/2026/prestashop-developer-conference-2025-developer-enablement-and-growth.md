The third PrestaShop Developer Conference took place in November 2025. Three weeks ago, we launched a blog series exploring the event's sessions and sharing key insights with the community. Last week's focus was artificial intelligence in PrestaShop development. This week, we're turning our attention to developer enablement and growth.

If you missed the event or want to revisit the key moments, we've made all sessions available on PrestaShop's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vavpAx3MdY&list=PLyZYn1MMU7-zV2l3LNEQh78Fjp83ip_Da).

From the Hummingbird theme version 2.0 to call for contributions, this week’s sessions cover how we enable and support developers. Let’s dive into the key takeaways from each session—click any image below to watch the full video.

With over 95% compliance with European Accessibility Act (EAA) standards, Hummingbird 2.0 enables merchants to build online stores that are accessible to all customers.

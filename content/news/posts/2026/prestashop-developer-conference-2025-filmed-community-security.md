The PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025 edition was another successful gathering! Over 140 people attended in person to connect, share experiences, and strengthen our community. For the first time, we offered a hybrid format, welcoming both onsite and online participants. Special thanks to **PayPal** for sponsoring the 2025 PrestaShop Developer Conference and presenting during the event.

Since then, we've been sharing highlights from the conference through a dedicated blog series, exploring topics like developer enablement, growth, AI, productivity, and modern development. Today, we're concluding this series with our final focus, community and security. From Friends of Presta to cybersecurity, the sessions in this post cover the community’s strength as well as cyberthreats for small and medium-sized businesses.

If you missed the event or want to revisit the key moments, we've made all sessions available on PrestaShop's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vavpAx3MdY&list=PLyZYn1MMU7-zV2l3LNEQh78Fjp83ip_Da).

This presentation was given by Stephan Obadia, CEO at BusinessTech & PrestaModule and by Thomas Rayrat, VP at Friends of Presta, an association that brings together PrestaShop professionals and experts.

Both speakers examine the ecosystem's context, addressing technical pressures around quality and module complexity, as well as growing security requirements. The structured community enables professionals to connect and share knowledge, while expanding membership to a broader audience.

Regarding feedback and perspectives, the presentation details both security considerations and developer networking opportunities. Thomas and Stephan then review the 2026 roadmap, which includes new working groups and tool integrations. FOP is also pursuing a website redesign and telling more about the FOP Days.

## SMEs and the age of cybersecurity

In this session, Estelle Naudin, Director Security Solutions at Mastercard France, explores today's digital era, where small and medium-sized businesses face growing cyberthreats. A single cyberattack can impact operations, erode customer trust, and harm reputation. For SMEs, proactivity is essential. Organizations must prioritize awareness, deploy robust tools, and continuously monitor evolving threats.

Mastercard provides in the filmed presentation a straightforward assessment tool that identifies and prioritizes cybersecurity threats without requiring any coding. 

## That's it for the PrestaShop Developer Conference 2025. See you in 2026!

In November 2025 took place the third PrestaShop Developer Conference. Over the past month, we've been sharing highlights from the event through a dedicated blog series. We've explored topics such as developer enablement, growth, AI, productivity and modern development. Today, we're bringing this series to a close with our final focus: community and security.

If you missed the event or want to revisit the key moments, we've made all sessions available on PrestaShop's [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4vavpAx3MdY&list=PLyZYn1MMU7-zV2l3LNEQh78Fjp83ip_Da).

From Friends of Presta to cybersecurity, the sessions in this post cover the community’s strength as well as cyberthreats for small and medium-sized businesses.

This presentation was given by Stephan Obadia, CEO at BusinessTech & PrestaModule and by Thomas Rayrat, VP at Friends of Presta, an association that brings together PrestaShop professionals and experts.

Both speakers examine the ecosystem's context, addressing technical pressures around quality and module complexity, as well as growing security requirements. The structured community enables professionals to connect and share knowledge, while expanding membership to a broader audience.

Regarding feedback and perspectives, the presentation details both security considerations and developer networking opportunities. Thomas and Stephan then review the 2026 roadmap, which includes new working groups and tool integrations. FOP is also pursuing a website redesign and telling more about the FOP Days.

## SMEs and the age of cybersecurity

In this session, Estelle Naudin, Director Security Solutions at Mastercard France, explores today's digital era, where small and medium-sized businesses face growing cyberthreats. A single cyberattack can impact operations, erode customer trust, and harm reputation. For SMEs, proactivity is essential. Organizations must prioritize awareness, deploy robust tools, and continuously monitor evolving threats.

Mastercard provides in the filmed presentation a straightforward assessment tool that identifies and prioritizes cybersecurity threats without requiring any coding. 

This final blog installment explores community building and cybersecurity, two pillars of sustainable ecommerce success. Dive into the videos, discover a thriving tech community, understand emerging cyber threats, and elevate your PrestaShop expertise. This concludes our series on the PrestaShop Developer Conference: we hope these insights have equipped you with the knowledge and tools to build, secure, and grow with the PrestaShop ecosystem.

Friendly reminder, that the public PrestaShop demo from the maintainers team will happen next week, on [**Wednesday, July 6, 2022 at 4pm CEST**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-JzJTygO_bg)!

We expect to share with you project news and present 2 very interesting topics:
- New password policy by [@matks](https://github.com/matks)
- New product page by [@jolelievre](https://github.com/jolelievre) and [@MatShir](https://github.com/MatShir)

In addition, [@eshraw](https://github.com/eshraw) will present you the new initiative from the Product Team, "Product discovery for v8.1 and above".

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so that even if you can't attend to the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!

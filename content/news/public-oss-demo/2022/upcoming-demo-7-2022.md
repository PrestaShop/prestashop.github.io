Friendly reminder, that the public demo for the PrestaShop Project from the maintainers team will happen next week, on [**Wednesday, October 5th, 2022 at 4pm CEST**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBz7lApJ_pA)!

We expect to share with you project news and present one topic:
- Update from PrestaShop 1.7.8 to 8.0 using [autoupgrade](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) module, by [@kpodemski](https://github.com/kpodemski)

At the end of every meeting, we hold a Q&A session. This month we decided to start gathering questions beforehand.
**If you have any questions about things related to the open source project** feel free to ask [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will answer them during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!

On March 5th, 2025, we hosted another Live Update for the PrestaShop Project where we shared more information about PrestaShop 9 Beta 1. We also took a sneak peek at what's coming to PrestaShop 9.1 thanks to a special guest from PrestaShop's product team.

## PrestaShop Live Update - March 2025

In this session, we focused on PrestaShop 9 Beta 1, stressing the need for developers to prepare for potential breaking changes and major updates within the PrestaShop ecosystem. Ilies, a product manager at PrestaShop SA, provided an update on the redesigned Discounts mechanism, showcasing a mockup and outlining the planned enhancements for the new Discounts feature in PrestaShop 9.1 and beyond.

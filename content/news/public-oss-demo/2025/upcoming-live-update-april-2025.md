The upcoming PrestaShop Project Live Update will take place on **Wednesday, April 23rd, 2025** at [4pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_23_Apr_2025_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkXkYbITS4A&ab_channel=PrestaShopProject)!

This edition will focus on the latest developments in PrestaShop 8.2.2 and PrestaShop 9. We’ll discuss recent improvements, new features, and what these changes mean for the community and merchants.

A special highlight of this Live Update: we will be joined by team members responsible for the Update Assistant module. They will present and demo the brand new **version 7** of the module, sharing insights into its new capabilities and how it simplifies the update process for PrestaShop stores.

Whether you’re a developer, merchant, or contributor, this session is a great opportunity to learn directly from the people driving these updates and to ask your questions live.

As always, we’ll wrap up with a Q&A session. If you have questions about the open source project or the Update Assistant, you can submit them in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7), or ask them live during the stream.

The session will be available for replay on YouTube if you can’t join us live.

We look forward to seeing you there!

Join us for the upcoming Live Update, where we will share exciting news about the PrestaShop Project! 

We will provide a summary of the **Call for Contributions: Hooks Initiative**, highlighting the community's efforts and achievements.

But that's not all! One of the highlights of this session will be an exclusive presentation on the highly anticipated **One Page Checkout** feature, coming in PrestaShop 9.1. This feature aims to revolutionize the checkout experience, making it faster and more user-friendly.

Don't miss this opportunity to stay updated and be part of the conversation!

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

The session will be recorded on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!

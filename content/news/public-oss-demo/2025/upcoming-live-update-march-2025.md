Join us for the upcoming Live Update where we will provide an in-depth walkthrough of the changes under the hood introduced in PrestaShop 9 Beta 1. This session will be particularly valuable for those looking to adapt their PrestaShop solutions or solutions integrating with PrestaShop to the new version.

There's more! During the upcoming Live Update we will also offer you a sneak peek into what's coming in PrestaShop 9.1, including a redesigned user experience for managing ~~CartRules~~ discounts!

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!

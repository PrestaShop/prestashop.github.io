PrestaShop 8.1 is a minor upgrade with major improvements. It's focused on making things faster and easier for you, transforming the way you use PrestaShop.

The entirely reworked product management page delivers a more efficient and user-friendly experience. This new page makes managing product combinations, prices, taxes, stock, and images quicker and easier. Multistore product management has also been drastically improved. Performance-wise, the new product management page is taken to a new level, especially for stores with a large number of combinations.

Additional new features include improved control over product availability labels, enhanced SEO settings for products, and support for multiple format image generation (WebP, AVIF). There are also a few improvements for developers, such as simplified access to the store's performance profiler.

For a deeper dive into these changes, check out the "What's New in PrestaShop 8.1 Page".

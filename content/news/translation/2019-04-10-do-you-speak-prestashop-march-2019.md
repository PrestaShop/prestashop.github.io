Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in March.

## Project news


### String freeze is comin’

… aaaaannnd PrestaShop 1.7.6 has entered code freeze, we are glad to inform you about this huge step we have just achieved! It means that string freeze is due as well, you can expect the new catalog to be pushed on [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) this week. Once this new translation branch created, it will be time for us to translate, correct and validate all fresh strings in order to get the most complete version for the 1.7.6 official release, planned for June. Let’s all make PrestaShop go in the right way… ready, set, go!


### Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated Guisardo. See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **13 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **213,652 words have been translated** and **7,802 validated**.
* All this in **14 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of March 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (99% translated vs 16% validated in 1.6).
* **Galician** (100% vs 62% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 71% in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (52% vs 24% in 1.6).

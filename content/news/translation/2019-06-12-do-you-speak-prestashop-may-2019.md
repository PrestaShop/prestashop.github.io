Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in May.

## Project news


### Malagasy

Say hello to the Malagasy translation project! It is now on our radar screens and extends once again the scope of PrestaShop. Come on, Malagasy people, subscribe [here](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/mg#) and join rabtaray on stage to make this translation project grow.


### Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated Abdullah_OneDot, Jonas (jonasburneika), Leon H. (leon0824), malik.krak, Rytis (Mangustux), and Neha Patel (nirupateldm). See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **56 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **63,533 words have been translated** and **57,226 validated**.
* All this in **32 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of May 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 16% validated in 1.6).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Galician** (96% vs 61% in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (52% vs 24% in 1.6).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 72% in 1.6).

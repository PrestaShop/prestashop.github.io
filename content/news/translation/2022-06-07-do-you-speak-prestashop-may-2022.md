Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in May!

## A few stats
 
* **15 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **10,793 words have been translated** and **8,705 validated**.
* All this in **26 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

Congratulations, and welcome to our new top contributors! :clap:
 
Remember, you can see who has been contributing to our translation project thanks to the [Translators page](https://translators.prestashop.com/).
 
## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of May, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **12 languages**. That’s great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Bosnian | Catalan | Chinese Traditional | Danish | 
| English | Estonian | French | Hungarian | 
| Lithuanian | **Portuguese, BR** | Swedish | Ukrainian |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, 42 strings were added on May 6 to Crowdin to fix [a bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_emailalerts/pull/57). To go back to a 100% completion rate, those strings will need to be translated and validated. Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean and Finnish are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to proofread. 
There isn’t much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!

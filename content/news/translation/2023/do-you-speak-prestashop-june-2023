Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in June.

## Project news

## 🌍Translating the PrestaShop documentation

If you didn’t know, you can help translate the [PrestaShop 8 documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/welcome/) into your own language! 
For now, it’s only available in English and French, but if you wish to contribute and translate it, let me know. Your help is always welcome! 🙌

If you wish to learn more about how to contribute to doc translations, check out the [Translator’s documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/translating-prestashop-software-basics/translating-documentation)! 

### 💕 Many thanks to June newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. This month, XXXX people joined the project and started translating right away!

Thank you all! 🎉

**10** languages are almost fully available:

||||||
|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Chinese (simplified) | Chinese (traditional) | Greek | Hungarian | Korean |
| Lithuanian | Persian | Portuguese (Brazil) | Romanian | Ukrainian |

There is only **1%** of strings to translate and proofread! 💪

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all of you, contributors! 🎉
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

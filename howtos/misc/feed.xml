          <description>Contributing code to PrestaShop can be scary for first-timers, because not everyone knows how Git works. By the time you have figured how to properly push your changes to GitHub, the codebase has changed, rendering your suggestions impossible to merge – leading to frustration on both sides. It’s high time you learn about git rebase.</description>

          <description>PrestaShop is an Open Source project. To most, this mostly means that the software is free of charge: you do not have to pay anyone for the default product. There is much more to this, starting with its community.</description>

          <description>As a serious developer, you need to use versioning (or “revision control”) for your projects, in order to track changes to your files… and be able to travel back in time when a disaster happens.

              <p>As we move into March, let&rsquo;s take a moment to review the progress made in February across the project. While PrestaShop 8.0.2 and 8.1 are certainly two key priorities, a lot of work has also been put in on other aspects of the project. Nonetheless, the final touches for PrestaShop 8.0.2 are currently underway, and progress on PrestaShop 8.1 continues to move forward steadily. Additionally, several exciting new features have been merged that will be incorporated into PrestaShop 9.0.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/theme/banner-core-monthly-wide.jpg" alt="Core Monthly banner"></p>
<p>Time doesn&rsquo;t slow down, neither does the work on the project!</p>
<h3 id="prestashop-802">PrestaShop 8.0.2</h3>
<p>Almost two months ago, PrestaShop 8.0.1 was released, and according to the project calendar, patch versions are expected to be released every 6 to 8 weeks. Although we are slightly behind schedule, our main objective is to ensure that the next patch, PrestaShop 8.0.2, improves the user experience rather than creates new issues. This version will address significant issues reported by the community and the project&rsquo;s QA (Quality Assurance) team. Notably, thanks to the contributions of <a href="https://github.com/alexandre-profileo">@alexandre-profileo</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Hlavtox">@Hlavtox</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31241">the problem with checking PHP session availability</a> on some servers has been resolved.</p>
<p>In addition, several bug fixes have been made regarding module updates in PrestaShop, which required changes to the core and <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_distributionapiclient/releases/tag/v1.0.3">Distribution API Client</a>.</p>
<p>In total there are <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A8.0.2+is%3Aclosed">more than 20 bugfixes</a> in this maintenance release. You can expect 8.0.2 to be available later this week. You can follow the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/31143">release progress here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prestashop-81">PrestaShop 8.1</h3>
<p><a href="/news/2023/prestashop-8-1-beta-release/">PrestaShop 8.1 has reached the beta phase!</a> Version 8.1 is still in development, all project members are focusing on reaching stability for the final release. I highly suggest reading <a href="/news/2023/prestashop-8-1-beta-release/">release notes for the beta</a>. If you are a developer, you may be interested in checking our new page in the developer documentation summarizing <a href="https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/core-updates/8.1/">notable changes in this version</a>. All updates regarding the release of PrestaShop 8.1 are available in a <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/30719">dedicated issue on GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>If you haven&rsquo;t had time yet to test 8.1, it&rsquo;s a great time to <a href="https://www.prestashop-project.org/get-involved/">get involved</a>. You can greatly help the project by testing your solutions in the new version and checking out newly added features.</p>
<h3 id="live-update--office-hours">Live Update &amp; Office hours</h3>
<p>Speaking of new features in PrestaShop 8.1&hellip; we held the second live update of the year: I think it was the best online PrestaShop event I have ever hosted, with three very exciting demos. You can read <a href="(/news/2023/live-update-2-2023/)">its full summary</a>, and if you haven&rsquo;t watched it, you definitely should. Demonstrations included an overview of the new product page. There was also a demo presenting the evolution of the Faceted Search module. And last but not least, our special guest <a href="https://github.com/samberrry">@samberrry</a> gave a presentation, proving that headless with PrestaShop is now a thing.</p>
<p>It will be impossible to do something better this week, but I still want to invite you for the third Live Update of the year, on <strong>Wednesday, March 8th, 2023</strong> at <a href="https://time.is/1600_8_Mar_2023_in_Paris">4 pm (Paris time)</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSNbRVRjAWk">YouTube</a>!</p>
<p>Remember that Live Updates are not the only way to exchange with project members. Almost every Tuesday, some project members take the time to discuss about questions and ideas related to the project. If you don&rsquo;t know what this is about, <a href="/news/2022/office-hours/">read more here</a>, and I&rsquo;m hoping to see you there!</p>
<h3 id="native-modules">Native modules</h3>
<p>As you can see by reviewing the list of recently released native modules, the work continues to release modules that are waiting for new versions for a longer time. There&rsquo;s also one notable change related to releasing native modules. Project maintainers <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ADR/pull/32">accepted the decision</a> to bump the module&rsquo;s major version, whenever a module changes the minimum compatible version of the PrestaShop core. This should allow the community to better understand the impact of released versions. The <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/blockwishlist/releases/tag/v3.0.0">Block Wishlist</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_linklist">Link List</a> modules are examples of PrestaShop 8 and above compatibility, which required bumping their major versions.</p>
<p>You probably know about the amazing new version of the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_facetedsearch/releases/tag/v3.11.1">Faceted Search module</a> which enables filtering on all the product list pages in PrestaShop, but there&rsquo;s also ongoing work around the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_googleanalytics">Google Analytics module</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_googleanalytics/pull/131">new version supporting Google Analytics 4</a> is coming. Two community members led this project: <a href="https://github.com/Progi1984">@Progi1984</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Hlavtox">@Hlavtox</a>. Universal Analytics, currently used, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528?hl=en">is going away</a> and will be replaced by GA4 on July 1, 2023. This highly anticipated integration with GA4 is now in the hands of the QA team, and you can expect the release very soon!</p>
<h3 id="prestashop-9">PrestaShop 9</h3>
<p>All changes you see merged against the <a href="#code-changes-in-the-develop-branch">develop</a> branch are part of the work on PrestaShop 9.0. And there&rsquo;s a lot of good coming to v9 already!</p>
<p>There are a few noteworthy improvements from <a href="https://github.com/Hlavtox">@Hlavtox</a>. He <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31499">simplified the Module Manager</a>, removing the &ldquo;See more&rdquo;, &ldquo;See less&rdquo; buttons that were frustrating for many users. Other than that, there are a few nice-to-have adjustments that will improve user experience in the back office. For example, information regarding the customer&rsquo;s default group <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31439">is now available</a> in a customer view, which is one of a few (<a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31111">#31111</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31105">#31105</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31104">#31104</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31440">#31440</a>) improvements <a href="https://github.com/Hlavtox">@Hlavtox</a> made on the customer view page.</p>
<p>We are still in the process of migrating PrestaShop back office to Symfony, and <a href="https://github.com/Progi1984">@Progi1984</a> is greatly helping with this process! He migrated a few pages (<a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31360">#31360</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29510">#29510</a>), still working on the next migrations and is actively helping with <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/28564">clearing the core from deprecated code</a>.</p>
<p>In this summary I couldn&rsquo;t miss mentioning a huge work done by <a href="https://github.com/unlocomqx">@unlocomqx</a>. We finally managed to <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/12422">merge his contribution</a> and get rid of legacy customization system from the core! Huge thank you to <a href="https://github.com/unlocomqx">@unlocomqx</a> for his patience and involvement.</p>
<p>Right now, there&rsquo;s a lot of work from other project members who <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31118">clean the core from deprecated code</a>, and, in general, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31193">improve the quality of the software</a>.</p>

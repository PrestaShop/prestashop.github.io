              <p>November was marked by the first PrestaShop Developer Conference in Paris.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/theme/banner-core-monthly-wide.jpg" alt="Core Monthly banner"></p>
<h3 id="prestashop-developer-conference">PrestaShop Developer Conference</h3>
<p>On November 30th, PrestaShop organized its first developer conference in Paris. The event was a great success, with around 150 attendees, over 25 speakers, and almost 20 talks. It was a great opportunity to discuss best practices for working with PrestaShop software, exchange experiences between developers and discuss PrestaShop development.</p>
<p>The great turnout proved to everyone we need more events of that type. A key element of the whole event was the great agenda and speakers who shared their knowledge with others. We were able to hear about CI/CD processes in large agencies working with PrestaShop, how to handle development of PrestaShop modules better, we learned more about security, how some processes work inside the PrestaShop open source project and much more.</p>
<p>For those who could not be with us: I have great news! We are working with speakers to develop content based on their talks. We will be posting articles on the blog in the next few weeks and inviting them to speak during the Live Update. We want to make sure that the knowledge shared by the speakers during the conference is made available to others. Stay tuned!</p>
<h3 id="live-update">Live Update</h3>
<p>Speaking of Live Updade, we didn&rsquo;t have it last month due to the fact that everyone was focused on the developer conference, but we are back this month! The next Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on <strong>Wednesday, December 20th, 2023</strong> at <a href="https://time.is/1600_20_Dec_2023_in_Paris">4 pm (Paris time)</a> on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CQ2Sg-v4XQ">YouTube</a>.</p>
<p>During the Live Update, we will go over the latest project updates and present two topics from the developer conference. We&rsquo;ll share more details soon.</p>
<h3 id="prestashop-813">PrestaShop 8.1.3</h3>
<p>The next patch version of PrestaShop 8.1.3 was originally scheduled to be released in December, but due to the fact that we are still working on this version we decided to postpone the release to January.</p>
<p>What can you expect from 8.1.3? There are quite a few bugfixes, including some significant ones. One pull request fixes the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34625">bug of missing stock change information for combinations</a> for modules. This could have caused a lot of problems because the Hook informing them of such a fact was not running correctly.</p>
<p>Also <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34600">a bug was fixed that caused JavaScript problems</a> and thus product management in the back office on the new product page.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s more to explore, so for a full list of changes you should definitely take a look <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A8.1.3+is%3Amerged">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prestashop-9">PrestaShop 9</h3>
<p>Work on the new major version of PrestaShop is not slowing down, as you can see by reviewing the list of code changes that have been merged into the core. As usual, the main release is a great opportunity to clean up some things and improve existing ones. It&rsquo;s also the big new features you&rsquo;ve been waiting for.</p>
<p>In the changes that are being made, you can see a great deal related to the back office migration to Symfony. The SymfonyLayout project still requires a few things but the whole project is slowly approaching completion. You can see <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/32875">the details in EPIC available on our GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>The other big project that is part of PrestaShop 9 is, of course, the implementation of <a href="https://api-platform.com/">ApiPlatform</a> to create a full-fledged API for the back office. It&rsquo;s a big project, but the whole thing is taking shape. As those who had the opportunity to be at the PrestaShop Developer Conference already know, the feature will be available in PrestaShop 9. Thanks to its modularity, it will be possible for the whole community to work on making a better API coverage, so back office events like adding products, categories, changing configurations or managing discounts, will be implemented as soon as possible. If you want to know more about the API, I invite you to the next <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CQ2Sg-v4XQ">Live Update</a>, where we will talk about it in more detail.</p>
<p>Another thing worth mentioning is updated jQuery, but not only in front office or back office, it has been updated everywhere thanks to work from <a href="https://github.com/Hlavtox">@Hlavtox</a>. You can see all the details in the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34382/">Upgrade jquery to latest version, drop polyfills PR</a>. This is a big change that definitely can impact your modules, so please check it out and make sure your modules are compatible with the new version of jQuery.</p>
<p>The new major versions also allow us to change, or fix, behaviors that don&rsquo;t quite work as they should and needed such changes. An example? Today, what happens when a product is added to the shopping cart, and it is only available in quantities of 1 item? We will see a message on the product card that says that the product is no longer available. This could cause confusion for shoppers, sometimes they leave the store thinking someone was faster than them and made an earlier purchase. Starting with PrestaShop 9, the whole thing will work differently. You&rsquo;ll have an option to <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/33931">Inform customers about quantity in cart</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Hlavtox">@Hlavtox</a>, we also have some other interesting changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work is underway on a project to change how product properties are fetched, so that instead of Product::getProductProperties we use lazy property loading thanks to ProductLazyArray. One part of this project is to <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34498">remove references to the <code>getProductProperties</code> method from where products are fetched</a>. This should speed up all front office.</li>
<li>Hlavtox <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34464">fixed the display of gifts in the shopping cart</a></li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the new version is not just a cleanup and changes under the hood. It&rsquo;s also changes that will realistically improve the user experience, whether it&rsquo;s for customers who buy from stores on PrestaShop software, or for merchants.</p>
<h3 id="modules">Modules</h3>
<p>The first module release that should catch your attention is certainly <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/blockreassurance/">blockreassurance</a>. <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/blockreassurance/releases/tag/v5.1.4">New 5.1.4 version</a> fixes some security bugs so don&rsquo;t forget to update.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy module is <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_googleanalytics/">the official integration with Google Analytics 4</a>. The module has undergone quite a few changes, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_googleanalytics/pull/155">and version 5</a> is in the testing phase at the moment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/productcomments/">comments module</a> has changed as well (although changes not yet published). The JavaScript code responsible for fetching them has been migrataed to vanilla JS, and instead of relying on jQuery <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/productcomments/pull/189">it now uses natively available fetch()</a>.</p>
<p>This is not the end! There&rsquo;s also a new version of the shopping cart module that brings sizable performance improvements. You can see the details of their implementation <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_shoppingcart/pull/94">here</a>, and they are available <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_shoppingcart/releases/tag/v3.0.0">in version 3.0 of the module</a>.</p>
<h3 id="welcome-to-dominik-shaim-new-prestashop-committer">Welcome to Dominik Shaim, new PrestaShop committer</h3>
<p>In November we welcomed a new PrestaShop committer - [@ShaiMagal](Dominik Shaim), community member from Czech Republic and founder of <a href="https://www.openservis.cz/">OpenServis</a>, company specialized in the PrestaShop hosting and support. Dominik is an experienced developer who works with PrestaShop since 2012, and he&rsquo;s been contributing to the project for a while now. We&rsquo;re happy to have him on board, and we&rsquo;re looking forward to working with him! You can see a list of all committers on <a href="https://www.prestashop-project.org/project-organization/people-and-roles/#committers">the PrestaShop project website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="prestashop-flashlight">PrestaShop Flashlight</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-flashlight">PrestaShop Flashlight project</a> that was presented <a href="https://youtu.be/tNAfcQhVmVM?t=817">during October&rsquo;s Live Update</a> welcomed new improvements. There are so many changes that it&rsquo;s hard to list them all so I invite you to the <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-flashlight">Flashlight repository</a>, where you can track the changes, see a refreshed user guide, usage examples and much, much more.</p>
<h3 id="developer-documentation">Developer Documentation</h3>
<p>In the documentation for developers, in addition to some fixes and minor changes, we also presented a brand new section explaining <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pull/1738">how to work with Symfony forms in PrestaShop</a>. You can see the documentation itself <a href="https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/components/form/">here</a>.</p>

              <p>The beta version of PrestaShop 8.1 is now ready for you to test!</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2023/02/banner_8.1_beta_1534x424.png" alt="PrestaShop 8.1 Beta is available"></p>
<p>We’re delighted to announce that PrestaShop 8.1 has reached the beta stage. PrestaShop 8.1 is still in development, but we hope you will help us test this release so we can have the best quality release possible, available for everyone, as soon as possible!</p>
<p class="text-center">
  <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/8.1.0-beta.1" class="btn btn-lg btn-success">Test PrestaShop 8.1.0 beta 1 now!</a>
</p>

<p>Version 8.1 fixes <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A8.1.0+label%3ABug+-label%3ARegression+-label%3Adevelop+">over 30 bugs</a> found in the previous release and introduces many improvements and new features.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, this beta version is pre-release software, and it is highly possible that you will encounter some issues. Do not use it in your production shop!</strong></p>
<p>Also note that upgrading a shop from a beta to the final version is not possible using the autoupgrade module.</p>
<h2 id="your-feedback-is-important">Your feedback is important!</h2>
<p>The beta phase is, for sure, the period of intensive testing and debugging, and you can help out. How? Check your solutions, and browse through the store&rsquo;s front and back office. See if what is important to you works as expected (or better!).</p>
<p>Here are some examples of how you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test the new features and improvements in this version.</li>
<li>If you are a module or theme developer, check if they work well with this new version.</li>
<li>If you notice any problem and you think the new version causes it, please <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new?assignees=&amp;labels=Bug%2CNew&amp;template=1_bug_report.yml">report it on GitHub</a>).</li>
<li>Don’t hesitate to <a href="https://devdocs.prestashop.com/8/contribute/contribute-pull-requests/">contribute to fixing bugs</a> if you can!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your feedback on this beta is essential.</strong> The more issues you report right now, the fewer issues there will be on the final release, which means fewer patch versions and fewer problems on your (or your customer’s) online store.</p>
<p><strong>Please submit all your feedback by March 16, 2023.</strong> If no new critical or major issue remains to be fixed by then, the first release candidate will be built and released a few days later. A subsequent beta version will be released if needed, and we will post on this blog when this happens.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about the version and its features, feel free to share them on <a href="https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/">the PrestaShop project’s Slack</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-can-expect-from-prestashop-810">What you can expect from PrestaShop 8.1.0</h2>
<p>This release is not only about fixing bugs but also introduces exciting new features! To help you make the most out of this update, we have prepared a list of new features and improvements that are worth checking out and testing. From changes for merchants to developer features, there is something for everyone in this release. Let&rsquo;s dive in and see what users can expect from PrestaShop 8.1.</p>
<h3 id="new-product-page">New product page</h3>
<p>After months of intensive work, the new version of this page is now available for all! The new product page eases many merchants&rsquo; everyday tasks when managing a product catalog. Improved management of combinations, stock, and images, and a completely rebuilt multi-store workflow, are just a few of the changes featured in this version.</p>
<p>The changes made in the new product page are not only about merchants. Thanks to the complete rework of the page, developers have <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/example-modules/tree/master/demoproductform">new and powerful means to customize it</a>.</p>
<p>The new product page is now enabled by default for new shops, but can be disabled using the dedicated toggle in the &ldquo;Experimental features&rdquo; section. Whether it is kept on by default for the final release depends on your feedback!</p>
<p>An article showing the full overview of the product page is coming soon to the build blog. For now, I recommend you <a href="https://youtu.be/XguCHCNlthA?t=2725">watch the demo from our last Live Update</a>.

<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XguCHCNlthA?start=2728" style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;" allowfullscreen title="YouTube Video"></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<h3 id="multiple-image-format-generation">Multiple image format generation</h3>
<p>Version 8.1 allows users to convert existing images to WebP and the newly-supported format Avif. Images in formats other than JPEG are now saved with their appropriate extension, like .webp for WebP, .png for PNG, and so on.</p>
<p>This new release also introduces support for multiple image format generation, allowing browsers to choose the best format for the browser.
This feature requires some extra work to have it working on your theme. You can check <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/classic-theme/pull/103">this PR from the <code>classic</code> theme</a> repository implementing this feature.</p>
<p>Please note that this feature is still considered experimental, and to access it, you must enable it through the Advanced Parameters section under the &ldquo;New &amp; Experimental Features&rdquo; option.</p>
<h3 id="manage-availability-labels-for-each-combination-separately">Manage availability labels for each combination separately</h3>
<p>Starting from PrestaShop 8.1, users can set dedicated text informing about product availability for each combination of products. Until version 8.0, users could only set it up on the product level. PrestaShop 8.1 allows you to change it for combinations as well.</p>
<p>For example, a merchant selling a t-shirt in three combinations of sizes (S, M, L) can now set a different <em>available_later</em> text for each size combination. This means they can inform customers that ordering size M will take 3 days to arrive, while size L is available on request and may take a month to deliver.</p>
<p>This feature is only available on the new product page.</p>
<h3 id="better-control-over-product-availability">Better control over product availability</h3>
<p>Another improvement worth mentioning is <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29720">the enhanced configuration for inactive products</a>.
In the past, every product had a hardcoded 404 redirection setting as the default behavior. To change the behavior for all products, users would have to run a database query or go through the process manually. In PrestaShop 8.1, a new field has been added to the settings, allowing users to configure this behavior more easily by setting a default value: for example, &ldquo;410 Gone&rdquo; for all the inactive products. It is, of course, still possible to customize the settings for each product individually.</p>
<p>Users can set their desired HTTP response depending on their SEO strategy. For example, some users may want to keep sending a 200 response and keep the products indexed, while others may want to send a 410 response to tell Google to remove the product from the index.</p>
<p>A natural addition to these changes is one that <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29570">improved the structural data</a> for products that are not available. As of version 8.1, there is also better <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29753">control over giving orders an &ldquo;On backorder&rdquo; status</a>.</p>
<h3 id="improved-maintenance-mode">Improved maintenance mode</h3>
<p>Starting from 8.1, employees can now access the front office even when maintenance mode is enabled. Previously, employees were required to provide their IP addresses to gain access to the front office during maintenance mode. It is no longer required, as you can simply allow all employees to access the front office during maintenance mode.</p>
<h3 id="improved-developer-experience">Improved developer experience</h3>
<h4 id="store-profiler-management-from-the-back-office">Store profiler management from the back office</h4>
<p>In previous versions, it was only possible to enable the profiler by manually editing a file. PrestaShop 8.1 now allows developers to enable store profiler directly from the Back office, making the process quicker and more convenient.</p>
<h4 id="improved-symfony-service-configuration">Improved Symfony service configuration</h4>
<p>PrestaShop 8.1 simplifies Symfony service configuration for PrestaShop modules. This version makes it possible to use some popular features introduced in Symfony 3.3, such as applying a <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-3-simpler-service-configuration#interface-based-service-configuration">configuration based on extended classes or implemented interfaces</a>, <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-3-simpler-service-configuration#interface-based-service-configuration">autoconfiguration</a>, and <a href="https://symfony.com/blog/new-in-symfony-3-3-psr-4-based-service-discovery">automatically registering classes found in specified directories as services</a>. <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/30588">It is possible to use them now!</a>. Additionally, this new version also resolves the issue of <a href="https://symfony.com/doc/4.4/service_container/autowiring.html">autowiring</a> not being available in the front office and WebService context.</p>
<h4 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h4>
<p>As with every big release, this version includes new Hooks and many other modifications aimed to improve the developer’s experience with PrestaShop. A <a href="https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/core-updates/8.1/">new page in the developer documentation is available</a> informing about all notable changes in PrestaShop 8.1.</p>

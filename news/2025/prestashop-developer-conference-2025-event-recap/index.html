              <p>On November 19, 2025, the PrestaShop developer community convened in Paris, and online via a global livestream, for the third PrestaShop Developer Conference. The program featured hands-on sessions, live demonstrations, and expert talks, alongside a major announcement. Attendees deepened their understanding of the PrestaShop ecosystem, gained project information, and explored practical advancements they can apply in their daily work.</p>
<h3 id="highlights-from-a-day-of-insightful-sessions-on-the-main-stage">Highlights from a day of insightful sessions on the Main Stage</h3>
<p>Throughout the day, the Main Stage featured expert-led talks from the PrestaShop community, unveiling a major announcement regarding MCP and also sessions regarding AI, PrestaShop Enterprise, PrestaShop Core, deployment, Hummingbird and call for contributions. Sessions focused on real-world techniques to help developers expand their skill sets and deliver more impactful projects with PrestaShop. The full program <a href="https://events.prestashop.com/e/prestashop-developer-conference-2025/en/sessions">is available here</a>.</p>
<p>The conference opened Wednesday morning with a welcome address from Olivier Binet, PrestaShop’s Managing Director and Alexandre Sarti, Head of Data at PrestaShop. Serving as Main Stage host, Alexandre introduced speakers and shared context and insights throughout the day.</p>
<p>Following Olivier’s and Alexandre’s speech, Olivier Fontenelle, PrestaShop’s Chief Technology Officer, and Clément Paillasse, PrestaShop’s Chief Product Officer, came to the main stage.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2025/12/OpeningKeynoteDevcon.jpg" alt="OpeningKeynoteDevcon"></p>
<p>During Clément’s and Olivier’s session, participants were welcomed, given an overview of the event’s themes, and introduced to the event’s big announcement: MCP, which is Model Context Protocol, an open source standard. MCP provides structured access to information to be used as context by AI.</p>
<p>The PrestaShop MCP Server was then introduced. Then, Stephan Obadia, CEO of PrestaModule &amp; BusinessTech, as well as Yoan Ballesteros, Developer at PrestaModule &amp; BusinessTech, took the stage to give some real-world examples of its use.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2025/12/MCPDevcon.jpg" alt="MCPDevcon"></p>
<p>Following the MCP announcement, Emmanuel Pays, Head of Solution Engineering Partnerships at PayPal, and Philippe Daly, PayPal’s Country Manager for France, took the stage to explore how AI agents are reshaping payments and shopping. Their talk was rich in insights, providing a wider vision on payments within the ecommerce ecosystem. After this session, Julien Bonvarlet, Engineering Manager at Core Engine at PrestaShop, explored AI and productivity, measuring the real impact of code assistants.
Then, Gautier Boudeweel, Senior Engineering Manager at PrestaShop as well as Soukaïna Barramou, Product Manager PrestaShop Enterprise at PrestaShop, covered PrestaShop Enterprise and a new developer experience.
At that point, a well‑deserved lunch break began and doubled as a great networking moment.</p>
<h3 id="tech-room-highlights">Tech Room highlights</h3>
<p>The Tech Room was the event’s second stage, where attendees followed a slate of advanced, hands-on presentations. Serving as Tech Room host, I welcomed presenters and introduced each session.
Compared to the Main Stage, it featured an interactive cadence of shorter sessions, allowing attendees to dive into specialized topics ranging from cybersecurity to automated testing.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2025/12/TechRoomDevcon.jpg" alt="TechRoomDevcon"></p>
<p>The more focused sessions let participants dive into diverse development topics and leave with practical, new techniques. The dual‑track format improved the experience by helping each attendee customize the day to their interests and goals.</p>
<h3 id="afternoon-sessions-and-devcon-branch--run-winners-announcement">Afternoon sessions and DevCon Branch &amp;&amp; Run winners announcement</h3>
<p>The day featured more than 18 presentations delivered by 28 speakers, many of whom traveled long distances - including from South America - to join us in the Paris region and discuss PrestaShop. We won’t recap every session here. Look for session posts on the Build blog in the coming weeks, with recordings linked—stay tuned.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the Main Stage hosted other exciting presentations! The first session was about the PrestaShop Expert certification - core skills, presented by Marine Petit of PrestaShop and Fabien Moreau of PrestaShop. Then, Ivan Ramirez of KIWIK and Jérémie Legrand of KIWIK came on stage to speak about automated deployment with Deployer. Next, Alexis Guyomar and Thibault Blivet, both from PrestaShop, introduced Hummingbird 2.0, created to help developers build faster and more accessible PrestaShop stores.</p>
<p>The next session, with Paule Morizot and Iliès Bahloul of PrestaShop, was about call for contributions, looking at early successes and future challenges. Then, Valeria Assetskaya of BelVG came on stage to talk about a technical audit focused on speed and security using ChatGPT and Gemini. Following this session, Mauricio Dinamarca of Canal Cero spoke about building robust ERP connectors for PrestaShop at scale.</p>
<p>A Q&amp;A with the PrestaShop Team followed, where Olivier Binet, PrestaShop’s Managing Director, Olivier Fontenelle, PrestaShop’s Chief Technology Officer and Clément Paillasse, PrestaShop’s Chief Product Officer, came to answer questions the audience had for them. Many topics were discussed, including the Hummingbird theme, stores in version 1.6 and 1.7, MCP as well as artificial intelligence - Julien Bonvarlet, Thibault Blivet, Benoît Houdayer, Alexis Guyomar, Jonathan Renard and others joined to help answer. There were many questions that received detailed answers, making this session one of the most impactful moments of the conference.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2025/12/QandADevcon.jpg" alt="QandADevcon"></p>
<p>At the end of the day, the DevCon Branch &amp;&amp; Run winners were announced. For this special occasion, Alexandre Sarti came on stage with Océane Juste, Global Event Project Manager. The winners were announced by Alexandre, huge applause to our champions: first place for Tanguy Jacquet, Axel Paillaud in second place and Daniel Raya Lara in third.</p>
<h3 id="cocktails-connections-and-community">Cocktails, connections, and community</h3>
<p>The day closed with a cocktail and networking reception, where attendees reflected on key insights and connected with developers, project contributors, and community members. The 2025 PrestaShop Developer Conference marked a clear success, underscoring our commitment to supporting and growing the PrestaShop project.</p>
<h3 id="why-the-prestashop-developer-conference-was-the-event-of-the-year">Why the PrestaShop Developer Conference was the event of the year!</h3>
<p>This year’s PrestaShop Developer Conference was an unmissable event for developers shaping the PrestaShop ecosystem. The venue, the gamification, the global livestream subtitled in 35 languages, and the major announcement made it feel like a clear step up from previous years. With presentations and engaging Q&amp;A sessions, it offered a deep dive into the latest developments and best practices. Attendees not only learned from insightful talks but also joined lively discussions that carried into networking sessions.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/images/2025/12/MainstageDevcon.jpg" alt="MainstageDevcon"></p>
<p>Did you want to come to the event but could not make it? We’ll share presentation highlights in the coming posts, and we expect this year’s insights to kickstart exciting projects.</p>
<h3 id="thank-you-paypal-for-sponsoring-the-event">Thank you Paypal for sponsoring the event</h3>
<p>Many thanks to PayPal for sponsoring and supporting the 2025 PrestaShop Developer Conference, and for taking the stage during the day!</p>

As part of PrestaShop's product redesign, we decided to replace Font Awesome and start using our own icon pack. We're sharing here the very first version of this new icon set, and we'll keep you updated when it evolves.

### Why these icons?
We're busy improving the global design experience in PrestaShop. It means giving a new identity to the software, and it starts with our own and unique icon set.
Besides, we felt the world needed a Daft-Punk icon...

### How does it work?

+We embed this pack in a webfont so you can use it on your PrestaShop themes, modules and even your own website.

As an open-source project, we believe in improving product design together. This PrestaShop icon-set is a little contribution to make things look better.

We're releasing it set under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). You can do pretty much what you want with it, except reselling it!

So feel free to use this set, play with it, customize it. Show us what you did with it!
We'd be also really pleased to be credited in your about page, or wherever you use the pack. Thanks in advance! :)

### So, where can I find it?

The PrestaShop icon pack is available in its own [git repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/icons-pack).

You can also view it here: http://build.prestashop.com/icons-pack/

### What if I'd love to see an Ewok icon there?

This icon pack is in Beta version. We're still busy improving it.
We'll add more icons to it, as well as change some names or shapes: it's a work in progress!

So don't hesitate to give your feedback on the git repository (or here, for that matter). We'd love to hear what you think about it!

The team at PrestaShop is busy preparing what's ahead for our e-commerce boat and community. There's a lot coming and **we're looking for some extra hands to come aboard**. So, what's this all about?

## Core team and Addons team hiring!

Developers at PrestaShop can thrive in two departments: the **Core team** and the **Addons team**.

The Core developers work on the future of the PrestaShop software.
<br>Addons developers focus on building additional modules sold on our marketplace, and improving the Addons platform.

Mostly. The Core and Addons teams are way more than that!


## What's in there for you

* [An awesome team spirit](https://www.instagram.com/prestacrew/)

* The tools of your choice: PhpStorm? Great! vim? Awesome! Atom? Sublime? Go ahead! Windows/Linux? We got ya covered!

[Last year PrestaShop launched its 1$ Million Integration Fund](https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/prestashop-launches-1000000-integration-fund-community/), conceived as a way to support a selection of developers by granting them funds to develop local modules. At the Paris PrestaShop Day 2016, we celebrated the first anniversary of the program.

Here are the figures that we achieved together with contributors from all over the world: $200,000 were granted to fund 130 modules that improve PrestaShop stores in more than 100 countries.

## It is still time to get involved

There are a lot of great development opportunities everywhere in the world. To help you pick a project to suggest, we summarized the priorities for the next few months regarding countries and module categories.

If you are a developer in one of those countries, have a look at the table below: we have listed which type of modules can be helpful to merchants in your region. We assume local developers are the best able when it comes to know what services are mostly used in their country.

You can also contact us thanks to the integration fund application form here: [https://addons.prestashop.com/en/integration-fund](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/integration-fund). We sometimes have module ideas that are waiting to be developed.

## Meet a contributor 

Daniel comes from Romania, and has developed several modules through the Integration Fund. Thanks to him, Romanian merchants can benefit of useful functionalities in their own language, such as the [eMag Marketplace module](http://addons.prestashop.com/en/22885-emag-marketplace.html?no_cache=1). This is what he told us:

It gathers developers, merchants, sellers and enthusiasts to help this awesome CMS grow even more. And the fact that everyone wins is truly awesome.

Personally, when I first saw this project I said to myself: "Wow! I gotta be part of this!". I started making some researches, then identified the needs and developed the modules. And now, here I am, witnessing and contributing to the ascension of PrestaShop.<br/>
I am proud to be a member of this huge community, I am one in a million more exactly :) </i>

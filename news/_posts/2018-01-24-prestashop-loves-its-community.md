And here comes the nice surprise... 2018 is here, following the gregorian calendar, let us wish you a successful and happy new year again! And thank you all for this huge year we spent together, on Crowdin or on GitHub, making PrestaShop so proud of its community. So we prepared this nice infography to have a look at 2017, to see how PrestaShop moved forward and feel fine about it. You deserve to do so!

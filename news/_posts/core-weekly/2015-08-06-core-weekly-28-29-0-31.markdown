This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last four weeks, from Monday 6th of July to Sunday 2nd of August, 2015.

Wow, is this report late! We're almost ready to enter the Core Monthly limit! So let's dive right into it. Thank you for your patience!


## Milestones

Important note: [A security upgrade was released last week](https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/prestashop-security-release/), for PrestaShop 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6! Version 1.6.1.0 is safe, but if you have any other version, please apply the patch! Read all about it [in the blogpost](https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/prestashop-security-release/), or find more technical details and how to apply the fix manually [in this text file](https://gist.github.com/Shudrum/27fc534de69c96617280).

Now that [PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 has been released](https://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/delivering-new-improved-v1-6-1-0/), the team is working on the next version of your preferred e-commerce solution.

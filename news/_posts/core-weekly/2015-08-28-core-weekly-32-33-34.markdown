This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop core codebase during the last three weeks, from Monday 3rd of August to Sunday 23rd.


## Milestones

We just released [version 1.6.1.1 of PrestaShop](http://build.prestashop.com/news/1611-maintenance-release/)! It's the first [patch version](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/) of branch 1.6.1.x, meaning that it only contains fixes and improvements, without any new feature. It is therefore a very safe upgrade from version 1.6.1.0.

Now that 1.6.1.1 is out, a month or so after 1.6.1.0, it is high time for your language to reach 100% on the project's [translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! Indeed, in her monthly "Do you speak PrestaShop" report, Alexandra reported that only 11 languages are at 100% for version 1.6.1.0. 6 were "almost there" (98-99% validated: Indonesian, Lithuanian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Portuguese BR, and Spanish). We'd also like to see someone take car of the Klingon or the  Pirate English translation :)

Want to contribute your code skills to the PrestaShop project?

Of note among the merged PRs since the last Core Weekly Report:

 * In PR 3570, Core developer gRoussac added two new module categories: "Customer Reviews" and "Social & Community".
 * In PR 3537, Core developer gRoussac added "Recommended modules" on Localization Tab.
 * In PR 3500, Core developer xGouley put a new project in place, using the forthcoming architecture: decrease stocks of a pack or its sub products in specific cases.
 * In PR 3722, Core developer gaillafr removed the use of safe_mode & deprecated our own Tools::getSafeModeStatus() -- since [the next major release will target PHP 5.4](http://build.prestashop.com/news/Dropping-support-php52-and-53/) where [this method has been removed](http://php.net/manual/en/ini.sect.safe-mode.php).
 * In PR 3724, Core developer gaillafr removed references to get_magic_quotes_gpc() -- since [the next major release will target PHP 5.4](http://build.prestashop.com/news/Dropping-support-php52-and-53/) where [this method has been removed](http://php.net/manual/en/security.globals.php).
 * In PR 3724, Core developer gaillafr removed references to register_globals() -- since [the next major release will target PHP 5.4](http://build.prestashop.com/news/Dropping-support-php52-and-53/) where [this method always returns false](http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-magic-quotes-gpc.php).
 * In PR 3719, Core developer gaillafr deprecated Tools::jsonEncode/jsonDecode in favor of [PHP's native JSON functions](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.json.php).
 * In PR 3704, Core developer gaillafr some functions that were deprecatd since PrestaShop 1.5. [Check them out](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/3704/files)!
 * In PR 3727, contributor Eolia made it possible to have a default value in Configuration::get().

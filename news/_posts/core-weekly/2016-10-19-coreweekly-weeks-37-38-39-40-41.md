This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the previous five weeks, from Monday 12th of September to Sunday 16th of Octobre 2016.

Wow, almost a month without a proper Core Weekly report! Sorry for that, dear readers!<br/>
So, this phonebook of a report is not called Core Monthly, 'cos I DO want to publish it on a weekly basis still. Next time! :)


## TL;DR

Yup, that's a lot to read through. So, here are a few highligts from the LONG list of changes:

 * Adding the parent/child inheritance system for themes!
 * Better SEO for faceted search.
 * Better PHP 7.0 support.
 * A HUGE number of fixes and improvements.
 * Several security fixes.
 * Some forgotten hooks are back, and some were added.
 * Improved installer.
 * Better phpdoc all around (thanks Michael Dekker for this initiative!).
 * And a LOT more!

## General messages

A few things happened in the past month, isn't it? First, we released [RC1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-RC1/) AND [RC2 of version 1.7.0.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-RC2/) (please test it!). We [formally introduced PrestonBot](http://build.prestashop.com/news/introducing-prestonbot/), we [put the techdoc site online for all to contribute to](http://build.prestashop.com/news/developer-documentation/), and as you'll soon see, we're about to release 1.6.1.8 :)

PrestaShop 1.7 development is going well, and we're getting a good feeling about it. There is a still a lot of ironing to do, but mostly, you should start working on your themes and modules :) Are your modules 1.7-ready? Have you tried to create a 1.7 theme? [Check the current tech doc](http://developers.prestashop.com/)!

You can find an up-to-date thread about the 1.7 development [in the forum](https://www.prestashop.com/forums/topic/480580-want-to-know-more-about-17/).<br/>
The 1.7 Project FAQ is always available here: [http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-faq/).

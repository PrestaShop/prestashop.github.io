This edition of the Core Weekly report highlights changes in PrestaShop's core codebase during the last week, from Monday 20th  to Sunday 26th of March 2017.


## General messages

As you can see again in this weekly report, most of the PR's currently being merged are in the '1.7.1.x'. We're closing the last planned tickets towards a [release of PrestaShop 1.7.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/announcing-our-2017-release-schedule/). Only a few more last-minute issues to fix, and we should be good to go! Get ready!

Following the update to the 1-Click Upgrade module, we had to break the string-freeze and introduce a few new/updates strings. Help us reach 100% in as many languages as possible for this release! [Contribute now](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) and be a part of the [translators hall of fame](http://translators.prestashop.com/)!

1.7.1.0 is coming! :)

## General messages

PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 was released 15 days ago today! As you can expect, the team is currently focusing on fixing the most critical issue that were discovered in that release a quick v 1.7.1.1. It should be released this week.

In the mean time, the more internationally-inclined of you might be interested in two recent Build articles in that area:

* **[What's New Regarding Translations In PrestaShop 1.7.1.0](http://build.prestashop.com/news/translation-news-171/)**: a short tour of the changes brought by the latest minor version, and how it makes things better for you, both as a merchant and a translator!
* **[http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-RTL-project/](http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-RTL-project/)**: launch of a public Trello board to share our ideas, intentions and progress on right-to-Left support for PrestaShop.
*  ...and of course, you can always [contribute to the translation](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) in your language!

You might have noticed that there has not been any change to the '1.7.0.x' branch for quite some time -- [since Week 9 of 2017](http://build.prestashop.com/news/coreweekly-week-9-2017/), to be precise. This is because the Core team now works on version 1.7.1.0, which continues the work done with version 1.7.0.0. If you are using PrestaShop 1.7.0.x, we encourage you to upgrade to 1.7.1.0.

## General messages

May is here! With the successful (and announced) releases of one minor version (1.7.1.0) and two patch versions (1.7.1.1 and 1.6.1.13), the team is now working on the next iterations!

So, this month should bring two new patch versions: 1.7.1.2 and 1.6.1.14. But what of the next minor versions? Well, keen readers of this blog already know:

* 1.7.2.0, which we intend to release in June 2017, will see the addition of a [brand-new Stock Management feature](http://build.prestashop.com/news/stock-management-in-prestashop-1-7/).
* 1.7.3.0, which we intend to release in September 2017, should see a great improvement on internationalization, [particularly for Right-to-Left languages](http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-RTL-project/).

As always, your feedback is more than welcome: see the two links above, and thank you for contributing!

See you on Trello, the Forge, or directly on GitHub :)

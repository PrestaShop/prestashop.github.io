## General messages

After a week of internal back and forth between QA and Dev team, PrestaShop 1.6.1.14 was released yesterday, yay! One week late from [our expectations](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/misc/2017-release-schedule/), but still, we're cruising along!<br/>
Likewise, 1.7.1.2 should land preeeeeetttty soon! :)<br/>

And, finally, a small update on the [test version of the 1-Click Upgrade module](http://build.prestashop.com/news/updated-1-click-upgrade-module/). We had issues on the .com, so we've decided to host the test module on GitHub for now. Please [download the test module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/download/16-to-17-beta-1/autoupgrade.zip) and give us your feedback on the latest changes!

## General messages

Last week came and went with a flash, and what a week it was!

For starters, most of the PrestaCrew Paris members were welcoming the community at PrestaShop Day Paris.

PS Day is always a great to celebrate the path so far, have a look at what's to come, and enjoy spending time together. It's always a special time for the whole team.

This one was special, as we celebrated PrestaShop 10th birthday -- [along with a couple of announcements](https://www.prestashop.com/en/press-releases/2017/06/15/prestashop-celebrates-its-10th-anniversary-and-announces-270000-active-estores-in-the-world).

Now that we are rested, let's focus on the year to come!

See you next year!

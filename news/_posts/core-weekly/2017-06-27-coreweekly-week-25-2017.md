## General messages

Let's just say that version 1.6.1.15 of PrestaShop should be released soon ;)

Also, the [1.7.2.0 GitHub milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/23) is 100% complete. This means that all current pull requests have been dealt with, and that we are entering the testing phase for this next minor version of PrestaShop 1.7. We're hoping for an early/mid July release. Fingers crossed!

Oh, also: if you're [building child themes](http://developers.prestashop.com/themes/smarty/parent-child-feature.html), remember that [they can have their own translation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/childtheme-example/pull/1/files) :)<br/>
Check out the ['childtheme-example' repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/childtheme-example) for a nice recap of this feature!

Have a nice week!

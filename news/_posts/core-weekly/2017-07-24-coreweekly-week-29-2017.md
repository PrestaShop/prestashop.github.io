## General messages

[We released PrestaShop 1.7.2.0 last week](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-2-0-available/)! It was a long ride -- it took a month more than we hoped for -- but we eventually go to it! Please enjoy, and give us your feedback on the [new Stock Management feature](http://build.prestashop.com/news/stock-management-in-prestashop-1-7-part-3/), so that we can improve it in the next versions!

In the meantime, we've started [gathering tickets and PRs for the 1.7.2.1 release](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/28), which should fix a dozen of small issues that were spotted in the final days of 1.7.2.0 development.

En in the meantime, as you can see below, we've started preparing for the monthly 1.6 patch release: 1.6.1.16 is coming soon!

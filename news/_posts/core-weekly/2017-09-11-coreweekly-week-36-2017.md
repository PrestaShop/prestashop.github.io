## General messages

Didn't I tell you last week that version 1.6.1.17 was coming soon? Well, [it did a couple of days later](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-17-maintenance-release/). Onwards!

We also told you more about the [UI Kit projet](http://build.prestashop.com/news/PrestaShop-UI-Kit/), which we would love to see community members participate in! Contact us at uikit@prestashop.com if you would like to contribute or submit ideas related to this project.

Finally, Core developer @maximebiloe wrote a bit about the [Parent/Child Theme feature](http://build.prestashop.com/news/Child-Themes-Feature/), which was introduced in version 1.7 but wasn't really explored on this blog. Read on!

Asking about 1.7.3.0, right? We're still working on it, and have a couple more things that need to be done before we freeze the code. Still, we expect to release it in late October. You can already [have a look at its code](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop) and try it out!

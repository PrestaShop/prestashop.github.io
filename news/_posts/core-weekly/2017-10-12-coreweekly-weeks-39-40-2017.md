## General messages

This week, you should really read our article about the future of PrestaShop 1.6: "[A year into 1.6 maintenance: the way forward](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-year-into-1-6-maintenance/)".

From the day we released version 1.7.0.0 in late 2016, version 1.6 has been put in "maintenance mode", with regular bugfix versions until October 2018 -- two full years after the release.

Now that we are at the 1-year mark, it is time to review what has been done, and to remind the community that they, as always, can play a crucial part of the development: namely, review one's Forge ticket to check that they can safely be closed.

Please, [read on](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-year-into-1-6-maintenance/), and together, let's plan the year ahead for 1.6!

## General messages

… and it is here! Version 1.6.1.18 has arrived, standing ovation! We know you’ve been waiting quite some time for it, thanks for your patience. It contains more than twenty bug fixes, see the list [here]( https://www.prestashop.com/en/system/files/ps_releases/changelog_1.6.1.18.txt). Note that the 1.6 won’t be maintained after October 2018.

Also, the [PrestaShop’s developer documentation]( http://devdocs.prestashop.com) is now online - it just needs to be completed! All the technical aspects of PrestaShop will be gathered here so that theme, module or core developers can use it whenever they need.

One more word. Last week was translation focused, first with the interview of [Roberto Calisto]( http://build.prestashop.com/news/contributor-interview-roberto-calisto), who has been a great help on the [Crowdin]( https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) Portuguese project, then with the monthly report. It throws very flattering light on the work accomplished so far because it is pure progress and involvement for now. How proud we are to gather such a community around!

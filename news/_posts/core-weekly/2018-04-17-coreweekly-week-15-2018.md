## General messages

Developers, we hear you! The hot topic at the moment is of course the RGPD and how to handle it with PrestaShop. Please take the time to read [our article on the topic, published yesterday](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-and-gdpr/). And, of course, we are working on more content about it, including some examples.

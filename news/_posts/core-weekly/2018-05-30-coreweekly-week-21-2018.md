## General messages

Last week, a few updates have been done on the core, plus on some native modules. You might also have to update your theme. Guess what: this is still in order to improve the GDPR compliance of your PrestaShop store. You can read the details on Build:

* [Update Your Store For GDPR](http://build.prestashop.com/news/update-your-prestashop-store/)
* [Release Of PrestaShop 1.7.3.3 And 1.6.1.19](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-3-3-1-6-1-19-maintenance-releases/)

Now, the most interesting part of this news: if you live in Paris, or if you need a good reason to come in Paris, [PrestaShop Day](https://prestashopday.com) is in 2 weeks. We really hope to meet you there ;-)

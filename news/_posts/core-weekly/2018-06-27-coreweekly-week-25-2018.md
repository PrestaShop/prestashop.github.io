## General messages

Hey guys, how are you? I guess that some of you could be interested by a better insight of the PrestaShop project evolution. You can know have a look at the [public Roadmap on Github](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects/1)!

A word about next releases: while the 1.7.4 still needs some work to be released, we will release soon some maintenance releases of 1.7.3.x and 1.6.1.x.

Also, in this Core Weekly, you will find updates about a module. A lot of work has been done on the Auto Upgrade module. Its second beta has been released this week, [v4.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.0.0-beta.2), thanks to the feedback of many testers. Thank you very much to everyone who helps to improve it!

I will try to give more details in the future in order to give you a better overview of the activity on the PrestaShop project at large.Please leave a comment to let us know what information interests you.

## General messages

Oh it feels good to be back, live from the Core Weekly! As Antoine is enjoying his holidays, I take up the reins, just to let you know what dev-changes happened during those last two weeks. And the first thing I can tell is that plenty happened! Indeed, about forty pull requests have been merged. A real World Cup score, right?

A lot of them regard bug fixes for PrestaShop 1.7.4.0. Consequently, a new patch version has been launched last Monday. Please welcome [PrestaShop 1.7.4.1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-4-1-maintenance-release)! Upgrading is still a bit sensitive, make sure you use the right module before; it ought to be version 4.0 of the 1-click upgrade, <a href="https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/download/v4.0.0-beta.3/autoupgrade-v4.0.0-beta.3.zip">currently available as a beta on GitHub</a>, instead of the version 3.0 available on the marketplace.

Also, you are probably aware of it already but who said we cannot write it again: we are very proud and thrilled to present our online [roadmap](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/projects/1). Making the roadmap public was one of our great wish for 2018, it is part of our plan to offer a clearer view of the future improvements and features we want to include in the software. Have a look at it!

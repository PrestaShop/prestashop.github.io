## General messages

This week, many people from the PrestaShop ecosystem came to meet the PrestaShop company at the Paris Retail Week. There was also a meeting at the Paris office, with French agencies and some of the top Addons contributors. That was great to share and discuss together about the present and the future of PrestaShop. Thank you to everyone who attended.

A quick reminder: please note that PrestaShop 1.7.5 code freeze will be on the 20th of september, and it's next week. After that date, no new wordings can be added, and only regression fixes will be merged into the release branch.

Module release:

* [Auto Upgrade 4.2.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.2.0)

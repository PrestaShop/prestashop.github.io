## General messages

Dear Developers,

Starting today, public [PrestaShop 1.7.x nightly builds](https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/prestashop-core-nightly) are available! This way, it should be easier for anyone who wants to contribute to the project to work with a recent build. Also, it means that merged pull requests will be in a build the next day for testing.

Something special happens last week: more than half of the merged pull requests are for modules.

"One last thing", as Steve Jobs used to tell: for the first time, the pull requests for the documentation are listed in the core-weekly. Documentation is very important, thank you very much to all contributors!

## A quick update about GitHub issues

Last week, [58 new issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:issue+created:2018-10-15..2018-10-21)  issues have been opened in PrestaShop's core repository, and [26 fixed issues](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is:issue+label:fixed+closed:2018-10-15..2018-10-21) have been closed.

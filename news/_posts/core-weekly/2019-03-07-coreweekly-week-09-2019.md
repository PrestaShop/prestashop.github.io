## General messages

Dear Developers,

It seems that we eventually found a proofreader for the devdocs ;-)

That is a very interesting kind of contribution: this is something that does not require coding skills, but this is still very valuable. The documentation is then more pleasant to read and to understand.

There are many activities that you can do if you want to help with the PrestaShop open source project, but you are not a developer:

- Telling that it's great and recommanding it
- Planning events
- Writings documentation and tutorials, or producing videos to show how it works
- Helping with issue sorting, like for example identifying duplicates or asking for details
- Helping users on the forums and other websites were users ask question about the software

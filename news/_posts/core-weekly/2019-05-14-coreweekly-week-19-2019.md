Dear Developers,

In case you missed it, [1.7.6 beta has been released yesterday](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-6-0-beta-release/).

Also, of course, your help is welcome to fix issues.

Please add the date to your agenda: [PSD Paris 2019](https://www.prestashop.com/fr/evenements/prestashop-day-paris) will be in a couple of weeks, the 4th of June 2019, at Palais Brongniart, Paris, France.

## General messages

Dear Developers,

While the last bugs and regressions are being fixed on the core in order to build a release candidate, you will notice that a lot of work has been done on modules too! And new versions of very popular native modules are coming :-)

Stay tune for the release candidate.

And of course, tomorrow, don't forget to join the PrestaShop team and partners at [the Madrid event](https://www.prestashop.com/es/eventos/prestashop-day-madrid).

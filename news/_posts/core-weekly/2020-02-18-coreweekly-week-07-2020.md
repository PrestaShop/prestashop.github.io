## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week our Product Team had a wonderful surprise: they received a notification telling them someone opened a [Pull Request on the Specifications repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/pull/86)! They were delighted to see the community willing to collaborate on us on this project.

Obviously we would be very happy to see more of this kind of contributions, so if you feel like doing some Product Owner/Manager work, [feel free to join in](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-specs/)!

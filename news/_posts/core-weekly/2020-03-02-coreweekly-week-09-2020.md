## About Multistore compatibility

Product Team member [@marionf](https://github.com/marionf) spent [a lot of time](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pull/463) working on the topic "What means 'a module is multistore compatible' ?" and went through all of native PrestaShop modules to clarify their status and wrote it into the README.md of these modules (see for example the [Block Reassurance module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/blockreassurance/pull/41/files)).

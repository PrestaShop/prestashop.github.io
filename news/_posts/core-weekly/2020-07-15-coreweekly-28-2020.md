## General messages

Dear developers,

Similarly to many other PHP Open Source Projects, we are now running [PHPStan](https://github.com/phpstan/phpstan) on Pull Requests being submitted for `develop` branch thanks to [Progi1984 work](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/19898). We think this wonderful tool will increase the overall quality of PrestaShop PHP code.

We are running only the first level, but [work is already happening to level up](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/20118)!

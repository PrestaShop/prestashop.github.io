## General messages

Dear developers,

The [1.7.7.0 Beta 2 build](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/18647#issuecomment-672940163) has been validated by QA team. The test campaign contained 414 manual tests, and
- 90% are successfull (373)
- 3% cannot be run in current context (blocked) (12)
- 7% are failing (29)

Since the 7% failing tests are not blocking issues, we will be able to deliver the build publicly and open the second beta period for 1.7.7.0.

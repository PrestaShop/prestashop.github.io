## General messages

Dear developers,

### 1.7.7.0 Release Candidate 1 status

The QA team is still running the test campaign on the second build for [**Release Candidate 1**](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/18647).

A major issue has been found in this build: [a change made from the Back-Office in an order that does not use the default currency results in the details of this order being displayed with the wrong currency symbol](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/21566) [#21566](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/21566).

Since this issue is located into the "View an Order" Back-Office page, it has been decided that a third build, created after the bug has been fixed, will be necessary but this 3rd build test campaign will only target the "Order" Back-Office pages. The other areas of the software will not be tested again as they have already been scanned during the current test campaign.

**If no other issues are reported, 1.7.7.0 Release Candidate 1 might be delivered at the end of this week.**

### A new external maintainer

The maintainer team welcomed another new member that is not a PrestaShop employee: contributor [@pululuk](https://github.com/pululuk), who [opened his first Pull Request for the project](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/15706) more than one year ago, was granted the maintainer status after [he submitted his application](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/issues/46) on the 2nd of October. Another major milestone for the project and a warm welcome for him!

### Notable progress on Continuous Integration

Thanks to [@Progi1984](https://github.com/Progi1984), our Continous Integration is now analyzing PrestaShop code under [level 3 of PHPStan](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/21241). PHPStan has been recognized as a quality vector for PHP projects and we hope it will greatly benefit PrestaShop.

### Composer v2 is released

You might have noticed it, the package Manager for PHP [Composer version 2 has been released](https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-0-is-now-available/)!

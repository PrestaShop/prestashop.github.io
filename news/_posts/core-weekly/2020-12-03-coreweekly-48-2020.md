## General messages

Dear developers,

The past week has seen many major releases for the PHP ecosystem: [PHP 8.0](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/), [Xdebug 3](https://xdebug.org/announcements/2020-11-25), [Flysystem 2](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/what-is-new/) and multiple versions of [Symfony](https://symfony.com/blog/a-week-of-symfony-726-23-29-november-2020) including the last Symfony 3 release: v3.4.47. Symfony 3 now enters Security Support stage where only critical security issues are fixed.

We are immensely proud to announce that [PrestaShop 1.7.7.0](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-available/) was released this week, one more item on this list!

Last week, thanks to the huge work of QA Team, multiples issues had been identified in the Release Candidate and had been fixed. At the start of the week, multiple issues in the upgrade process from previous 1.7 versions to 1.7.7.0 were also identified.

As the ability to upgrade is a major keystone for security and stability, we fixed these upgrade issues in PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 and released a patched version of the [Autoupgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.11.0). If you plan on upgrading your shop to 1.7.7 and your current version is below 1.7.6 you need this version (v4.11.0) of the autoupgrade module.

As usual, it is recommended to be careful before starting to update your website to the latest version:

- Backup your database and your files
- Test the update on a testing or pre production server
- If everything is fine, then update on the production environment

## General messages

Dear developers,

In case you did not see it, [PrestaShop 1.7.7.0](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-available/) was released last week!

Note that if you plan on upgrading your shop to 1.7.7 and your current version is below 1.7.6 you need the latest version ([v4.11.0](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.11.0)) of the autoupgrade module.

As usual, it is recommended to be careful before starting to update your website to the latest version:

- Backup your database and your files
- Test the update on a testing or pre production server
- If everything is fine, then update on the production environment

Following the early adoption of PrestaShop 1.7.7, [some bug reports](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AAutoupgrade+label%3A1.7.7.0) have been submitted about upgrade issues. The maintainer and QA team are all hands on deck exploring and fixing these issues.

If you notice issues with PrestaShop 1.7.7.0, you can [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues) and go even further by submitting a [pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/compare) to help fix it!

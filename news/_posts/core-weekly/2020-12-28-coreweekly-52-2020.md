## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week, maintainer [@kpodemski](https://github.com/kpodemski), helped by [@Progi1984](https://github.com/Progi1984) built the ZIP archive for [PrestaShop 1.7.7.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/22306) and delivered it to QA team for validation. This is the first time a PrestaShop release is built by someone who is not an employee of PrestaShop company! Congratulations [@kpodemski](https://github.com/kpodemski)!

As the end of this year is coming, we also wanted to say thank you to all PrestaShop developers for this year, although it has been difficult for many.

Looking forward to 2021 :)

## General messages

Dear developers,

Last week, the maintainers team held again a video conferencing for the project public demonstrations session, streamed live on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/JBvJgoo-rLg).

The version 2.0.0 of module blockwishlist is now [complete](https://github.com/PrestaShop/blockwishlist/pull/77). This is a wide rework of the module capacities and codebase, and it will be compatible with PrestaShop 1.7.6 and newer versions.

The release has not been done yet and should follow soon.

Finally the kanban for `1.7.7` branch is not empty yet, it still contains unresolved regressions reported on versions 1.7.7.0 and 1.7.7.1. The next batch of bugfixes for 1.7.7 will be delivered in patch version 1.7.7.3, which is scheduled to be delivered within [the next 6 weeks](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/project/release/minor-release-lifecycle/).

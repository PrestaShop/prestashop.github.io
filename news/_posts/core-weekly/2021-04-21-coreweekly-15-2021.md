## General messages

Dear developers,

We are immensely proud to announce that PrestaShop 1.7.8.0 is frozen!!! 🍾️ 🎉️ ☃️

A quick look at the work done on 1.7.8:

- [436 GitHub issues have been fixed](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.7.8.0+is%3Aclosed+label%3AFixed)
- [1232 Pull Requests have been merged](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A1.7.8.0+is%3Amerged)

The last weeks have been intense for all PrestaShop teams but we are very happy about the result... and we hope you will love it too.

The `1.7.8.x` branch has been created and any new changes submitted in the `develop` branch will be milestoned for 1.7.9 .

### What are the next steps?

Following the freeze, the QA team will perform a large test campaign to explore the 1.7.8.0 and evaluate how much stabilization it needs.

This test campaign will tell us how 'mature' the `1.7.8.x` branch, and give us indications about when the Beta period could start.

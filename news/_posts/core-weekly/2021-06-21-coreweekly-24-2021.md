## General messages

Dear developers,

A lot of efforts are being directed on fixing the last known bugs in PrestaShop 1.7.8 in order to deliver soon a first Release Candidate. If you have not tested the beta yet, please be aware that only one week remains for the beta phase.

In the meantime, work continues on `develop` branch for next version. Two major Pull Requests have been merged this week for the next version: [the upgrade of Symfony framework to version 4](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/24609) and [the removal of Addons modules being installed](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/24676) from the installer. These two items are part of the [1.7.9 draft roadmap](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/24111) that should soon be completed.

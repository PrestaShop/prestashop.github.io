## General messages

Dear developers,

Release patch 1.7.7.6 is [close to being delivered](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25202#issuecomment-889844880) while Release candidate 1.7.8.0 is also [close to the exit door](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/23010#issuecomment-890881293).

We are also preparing a new format for the incoming [Public OSS Demo](https://build.prestashop.com/news/upcoming-demo-7-2021/).

You might have noticed some heavy work being done [on the developer documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pull/1095). We will soon have [to maintain multiple versions documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues/1090), this requires changes in how we control the content. Two new repositories: [Devdocs theme](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps-docs-theme) and [Devdocs sources](https://github.com/PrestaShop/devdocs-site) have been created.

## General messages

Dear Developers,

It seems this week is off to a great start. :smile:

The [**first Release Candidate**](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-8-0-rc-release/) of PrestaShop 1.7.8.0 has finally been delivered yesterday, after multiple weeks spent carefully strengthening and stabilizing it.

This Release Candidate is open for testing for two weeks. On October 5th, if no critical or major regression has been reported, PrestaShop 1.7.8.0 will be delivered as a stable version. Just in the middle of [Hacktoberfest 2021](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)...

Please help us test this build to make sure this release is a success!

Furthermore, PrestaShop [1.7.7.8](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-8-maintenance-release/) has been released. Don't forget to update as this patch version fixes one major regression.

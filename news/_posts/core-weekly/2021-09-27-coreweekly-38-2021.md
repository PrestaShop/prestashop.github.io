## General messages

Dear developers,

Have you tested the [first Release Candidate of PrestaShop 1.7.8.0](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-8-0-rc-release/)? Now is the best time to download and test this RC version as a test store! The later a problem is identified, the more time it takes to be fixed, and this delays the final release.

In the meantime, you might want to have a look at (and join?) these interesting discussions:
- [ADR 15](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ADR/pull/21): discussing how to split business logic from DOM management in JavaScript classes and components
- [Issue 25975](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25975): what should we do with the Front-Office theme for PrestaShop 8.0.0 ?

Following the publication of [version 1.6.1.1 Release Candidate 1](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-1-rc1/), we have fixed a few more issues that had been identified. Thanks for helping with the tests and for the feedback!

[As announced earlier](http://build.prestashop.com/news/announcing-prestashop-1-6-1-1/), version 1.6.1.0 turned out great, but there were still a few bumps here and there. We have fixed the main issues that were reported: 163 pull requests were merged into this version!

We'd like to keep testing it with the help of our Community!
We need you to make sure that this release is as bug free as possible. Everyone can participate: merchants, developers, designers, translators, ... even customers! Test your modules, test your themes, make a test-upgrade on a copy of a real shop, etc.

Remember that 1.6.1.1 RC2 is a test version, and is therefore not yet deemed suitable for production use. Hence, do not upgrade your store just yet! Install the RC2 on your server (on as many server configurations as possible), or upgrade from a clone of your real store.

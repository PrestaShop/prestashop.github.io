Remember! This is the second release candidate for 1.6.1.2, NOT the final, production-ready code! <b>This is a test version</b>, and is therefore not yet deemed suitable for production use. Hence, do not upgrade your store just yet! Install the RC2 on your server (on as many server configurations as possible, please!), or upgrade from a clone of your real store.

It was fixed by our Core team at around 3 PM (Paris time). If you downloaded the RC2 before that time, please download it again!

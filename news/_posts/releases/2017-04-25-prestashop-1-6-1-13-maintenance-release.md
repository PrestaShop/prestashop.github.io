As the version number indicates (as per [our SemVer-like versioning](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/)), this is the 13th patch release for PrestaShop 1.6.1.0.<br/>

As usual, if you are currently running promotions leading to high traffic on your website, we recommend that you wait for the promotion to end before attempting any upgrade and technical change to your store.

We hope you enjoy this new release!


### The changes

For a full list of changes, [see the list of pull requests merged into the 1.6.1.x branch in this milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Amerged%20milestone%3A1.6.1.13%20)

Here are some of the most notable changes that this version brings:

* Allow stock transfer between warehouses in multishop context
* Fix search in Advanced Stock Management
* Use native round instead of 2 forced decimals
* Replace comma with dot in special price
* Fixes on must-have module upgrade
* Fix price display when quantity discount on combination
* ...and several other fixes.


The [PrestaShop 1.6.1.13 changelog](https://www.prestashop.com/en/previous-versions) is available.

Since version 1.6.1.13 is a "patch" update to version 1.6.1.0, upgrading from that version will be as smooth as silk for everyone: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.6.1.0 will work just as well with 1.6.1.13.

A huge "thank you!" to each of the 7 outside contributors, who gave their time and knowledge for the benefit of the whole PrestaShop community! [You too can contribute to the next version](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Contributing+code+to+PrestaShop)!

Let's go, [upgrade your store(s)](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Updating+PrestaShop)! Upgrading from 1.6.1.0-1.6.1.12 is completely safe, upgrades from a standard 1.6.0.x version should work just as well, and those upgrading from version 1.5, 1.4 or even 1.3 should take their time and pay attention to their modules, their theme and their custom modifications!

As the version number indicates (as per [our SemVer-like versioning](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/)), this is the 16th patch release for PrestaShop 1.6.1.0.

As usual, if you are currently running promotions leading to high traffic on your website, we recommend that you wait for the promotion to end before attempting any upgrade and technical change to your store.

We hope you enjoy this new release!

The [PrestaShop 1.6.1.16 changelog](https://www.prestashop.com/en/system/files/ps_releases/changelog_1.6.1.16.txt) is available.

Since version 1.6.1.16 is a "patch" update to version 1.6.1.0, upgrading from that version will be as smooth as silk for everyone: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.6.1.0 will work just as well with 1.6.1.16.

This release had 12 contributors, both from PrestaShop and from the Community at large.

A huge "thank you!" to each of the 8 outside contributors, who gave their time and knowledge for the benefit of the whole PrestaShop community! [You too can contribute to the next version](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Contributing+code+to+PrestaShop)!

Let's go, [upgrade your store(s)](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Updating+PrestaShop)! Upgrading from 1.6.1.0-1.6.1 is completely safe; upgrading from a standard 1.6.0.x version should work just as well. Those upgrading from version 1.5, 1.4 or even 1.3 should take their time and pay attention to their modules, their theme and their custom modifications!

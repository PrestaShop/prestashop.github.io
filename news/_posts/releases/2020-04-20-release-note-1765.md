As announced a few months ago, the PrestaShop core team has decided to make a forthright patch release process and deliver patch versions on a more regular basis, every time it’s needed. So here we are, 6 weeks after the release of 1.7.6.4, PrestaShop 1.7.6.5 is now available! 

![1.7.6.5 is available!](/assets/images/2020/04/1765banner.jpg)

This maintenance release is a bit special as it does not only fix regressions found on version 1.7.6.0 to 1.7.6.4, but it also has put a focus on fixing many security issues, from 1.5, 1.6 and 1.7 versions. This is a result of a huge work on security which has been started a few weeks ago to ensure more security on the PrestaShop software. In the near future, PrestaShop will focus more and more on security to ensure that no security breaches, even minor ones such as permission issues, are left out in the core. 

As this patch fixes several security issues, we highly recommend to upgrade your shop as soon as possible. Of course, as always, don’t forget to backup before.

Reminder:  the 1-Click Upgrade module’s latest version is [v4.10.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.10.1), don’t forget to upgrade it.

Since version 1.7.6.5 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.6.4, upgrading from any 1.7.6 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.6.x will work just as well with 1.7.6.5. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.

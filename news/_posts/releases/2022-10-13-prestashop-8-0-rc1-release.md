The maintainers team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of PrestaShop 8.0.

![PrestaShop 8.0 Release Candidate is available!](/assets/images/2022/10/bannerPS8_RC1.png)

This is the last step before releasing the final 8.0 version. This release candidate is intended to allow the community to verify that all regressions found during the beta have been fixed and that the software is ready for production. If no major or critical regression is reported before October 20th, then the final version of 8.0 will be made available.
Remember, this release candidate might still include issues. Do not use it in your production shop!

Please note that it is not currently possible to upgrade from the beta to the release candidate, nor upgrade from this release candidate to the final release using the upgrade module.

## Your feedback is important!

Similar to the public beta, the release candidate is an extremely important phase to prepare for the upcoming release. During this period, we encourage everyone in the community to download this version and test how it behaves in their unique environment.

Here are some examples of how you can help:
* If you have access to a real shop, set up a copy of it in a separate environment and update it to PrestaShop 8 using the [upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases). See if you notice any issues on the shop compared to your previous version.
* If you are a module or theme developer, check if they work well with this new version.
* If you notice any problem and you think it is caused by the new version, please [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose).
* Don’t hesitate to [contribute to fixing bugs](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/contribute/contribute-pull-requests/) if you can!

*Your feedback is essential.* The more issues you report right now, the fewer bugs there will be on the final release, which means fewer patch versions and fewer problems on your (or your customer’s) online store.

*Please submit all your feedback by October 20th, 2022.* If no new critical or major issue remains to be fixed by then, the final release will be made available. This is the final chance to test this new version before the final release is out!

If you have any questions about the version and its features, feel free to share them on [the PrestaShop project’s Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/).

And if everything is working well, feel free to comment on this article to tell us, and share your thoughts on social networks, we also need this kind of feedback! ;-)

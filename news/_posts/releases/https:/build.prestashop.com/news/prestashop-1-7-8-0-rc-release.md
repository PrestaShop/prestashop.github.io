![1.7.8 RC is available!](/assets/images/2021/09/178RC-banner_1200_628_en.jpg)

A few months after the beta, the first release candidate for PrestaShop 1.7.8.0 is now ready for you to test!

This is the last step before releasing the final 1.7.8.0. This version aims to verify that all regressions found during the beta have been fixed and that the software is ready for production. If no major or critical regression is reported by October 5, then the final version of 1.7.8.0 will be made available.

Please note that it is not currently possible to perform an automatic upgrade from the Beta to the Release Candidate. It will also not be possible to upgrade from this Release Candidate to the final release.

Go download and install this RC version as a test store, either on your machine or your web hosting, then play with it – and give us your feedback! We need YOU to test this new version of PrestaShop. The later a problem is identified, the more time it takes to be fixed, and this delays the final release.

If you find regressions compared to the 1.7.7 version, please open an issue and describe it on [Github](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new?template=1_bug_report.md) so that it can be reproduced and fixed as soon as possible.
Remember, this release candidate version is pre-release software. Do not use it on your production shop!

## Notable changes since the RC release

This RC fixes 60 bugs including 13 major ones that were detected between the beta and the RC.

Deep work has been done around the correction of bugs in the product page, the upgrade from version 1.6.1.24 to version 1.7.8.0, and the multistore.

Check out the [changelog](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/1.7.8.0-RC.1) to see in detail all the changes. 

All the major bugs have been treated, [the other minor](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.7.8.1+) will be fixed in the 1.7.8.1 release patch which will arrive soon.

## How to help finish the 1.7.8

Your feedback on this RC is essential, the regressions you find right now are as many bugs less on the final version and fewer patch versions. It also means fewer problems on your (or your customer’s) online store.

You must:

- Install it and test that there is no regression compared to the 1.7.7 version
- If you develop modules or themes, test them on this version
- Test the auto-upgrade plugin
- [Report regressions on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues) (read how to [report issues](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/contribute/contribute-reporting-issues/))
- Fix regressions by creating a [pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/compare) (read the [contribution guidelines](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/contribute/contribution-guidelines/))

If everything is working well, feel free to comment on this article to tell us, and share on social networks, we also need this kind of feedback! ;-)

With the launch of the build.prestashop.com blog, we’ve been planning for a while to highlight the dedicated work of the community on the [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official).

So, better late than never, here is the report for May 2015, which is a snapshot of the project at the end of May.
The idea is to give you a quick summary of what has been going on over there, what languages are the most active and other information about our translating community.

All the figures and statistics are based on the 1.6.0.14 project, which is the last stable version released to date.

## Top contributors

A big applause to all our contributors for the hard work!



## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

As you might know a translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs translated string, to make sure everyone benefit from the latest translations!

These languages need you as proofreaders as well:

* Turkish (89% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (75% vs 25%)
* Ukrainian (92% vs 48%)
* Vietnamese (42% vs 16%)
* Hungarian (96% vs 80%)

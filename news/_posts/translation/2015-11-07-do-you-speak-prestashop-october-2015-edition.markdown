Here is the new (and late) report to inform you of what has been going on [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) this October 2015.

But first, a quick reminder on what we call dependent languages, and how it works in Crowdin!

## Dialects and dependent Languages

Some languages like German or Spanish are used in several countries (or regions) and each of these countries can have its own variations from the primary language. For this reason, these countries have a dedicated project like Austria or Mexico.

When you look at the translation progress, you'll often see some lower completion (far from 100% completed) for such languages. It doesn't mean the project won't be fully translated in these languages in the end!

Indeed, when depending on another language, these local projects inherit from the existing translation of the main project.
If you look at the "German, Austria" project, currently 1% translated, it means 1% of the strings have been adapted to the Austrian market. If you install the Austrian language in your shop, the remaining 99% will be translated in German: it is automatically fetched from the primary German project. Convenient!

Today, the following languages work this way:

* English, Zimbabwe`
* French, Quebec
* German, Austria
* German, Luxembourg
* Portuguese, Brazilian
* Spanish, Argentina
* Spanish, Colombia
* Spanish, Mexico
* Spanish, Peru

So, if you're working on one of these languages, you should **focus on the translations specific to your region**. No need to translate everything, it's probably already been done!

If you have any question regarding about this, leave us a comment. And if you want to help adapting PrestaShop to these countries, join the [translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!


Now, let's review what happened last month for PrestaShop translations.

All the figures and statistics are based on the 1.6.1.0 project.

## Complete translations

#### Fully translated languages

At the end of October, PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in 6 languages:

* Bulgarian
* Dutch
* English
* German
* Slovenian
* Swedish


#### 98-99% translated languages

…and almost fully translated (and validated) in these 11 languages:

* French
* Indonesian
* Italian
* Lithuanian
* Norwegian
* Persian
* Polish
* Portuguese, Brazilian
* Russian
* Spanish
* Swedish

The translators being very reactive (yes, thanks again!), these languages should be soon 100% translated (if not already by the time you read this).


## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with the previous month, the following languages had the best progress in October:

* Khmer (+25% to reach 5% translated!)
* Malay (+15% to reach 45% translated)
* Spanish, Argentina (+8% to reach 26% translated)

Congratulations to all our contributors for the hard work!

## New languages

At the request of community members, we've recently added some new languages to the project.
You can now translate PrestaShop in:

* [Filipino](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/fil)
* [Mongolian](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/mn)

So don't hesitate to join these!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

These languages (still) need you as proofreaders:

* Turkish (92% translated vs 0% validated)
* Slovak (77% vs 24%)
* Ukrainian (97% vs 53%)
* Galician (45% vs 11%)
* Finnish (75% vs 58%)

## A word from the community

Here is an update on the latest initiatives from members of the translation community.

### Spanish
Translator Jesús Ruiz García ([jruiz](https://crowdin.com/profile/jruiz) - who's also helping us with the [Spanish documentation of PrestaShop](http://doc.prestashop.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=26148899), thank you Jesús!) has started a **Spanish glossary**, to make sure everybody uses the same terms for translation. It's gathered under an online document here: [Spanish glossary](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ndjk_bt0wXul1bQwz5KJ_PpM8BcwZhTBo4sfbtVoBwg/edit?usp=sharing).

More information about it on Crowdin, with [this discussion](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/discussions/253).
If you want to help, get in touch with Jesús on Crowdin!

### Turkish
Remember, Turkish translator ftugrul still wants to gather the Turkish community.
Join the [discussion on Crowdin forum](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/discussions/210) to harmonize the translation and go forward with more proofreading.

Here is the latest report to inform you of what happened on the [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) in August.

## Project news

### Thanks for pursuing the effort <3

This month was quite a good month for PrestaShop's project in Crowdin.The quantity of words translated and validated is huge compared to the same period last year. Thanks to all of you, old and new members, for this
This month we would like to say a special thank to an amazing member of our community, Jesús Ruiz García, for the huge quantity of work done in translating the documentation since he joined the community and especially for his precious help and tips on terminology and glossary. For more information, check our related [Build article](http://build.prestashop.com/howtos/translation/how-to-help-translating-PrestaShop-into-Spanish/). **<3**

### Updated files in 1.7

As the 1.7 project keeps evolving, so does the translation project. What’s new:

* The content of the emails is now available for translation in 1.7. Subjects for emails will arrive soon as well.
* New domains were added:
  * *Emails*
  * *Admin.Stats*
  * *Admin.ShopParameters* and *Admin.AdvParameters*: resulting from the splitting of former Admin.Parameters into two folders, thus providing more context.



### Updated 1.6 translations

The last update of translations for the 1.6 project took place on the 6th of September. Another update is planned this week so you can benefit from the latest translations available on Crowdin!

### New locales

#### Spanish from Venezuela

A new locale is available for Spanish: [Spanish from Venezuela](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/es-VE#). If you want to take part into it and help Maurizioag, our first translator in Venezuelan Spanish. join us on Crowdin!
Because it’s a locale, you will only have to adapt the Spanish text to fit the Venezuelan peculiarities.

#### Malagasy

At the request of a community member, we’ve also added [Malagasy](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official/mg#) to adapt PrestaShop to Madagascar’s market :)

Help us translate PrestaShop in these new languages!

Now let's get back to our Crowdin project and to the full report of its activity in August:

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with July 2016, the following languages had the best progress in August:

(these numbers are mostly issued from the progress of the 1.7 project, as this is where most of the work took place this month.)
* **Galician** (+34% to reach 67% translated in 1.6)
* **Finnish** (+19.3% to reach 99% translated in 1.6.
* **Latvian** (+15.2% to reach 38% translated in 1.6)
* **Hungarian** (+3.3% to reach 95% translated in 1.6)
* **Portuguese** (+3.1% to reach 100% translated in 1.6)

Of course this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

At the end of August, 6 languages would still benefit from more proofreading:


* Estonian (93% translated vs 0% validated)
* Turkish (99% translated vs 46% validated)
* Galician (67% translated vs 14% validated)
* Ukrainian (99% translated vs 61% validated)
* Arabic (54% translated vs 28% validated)
* Hungarian (95% translated vs 82% validated)

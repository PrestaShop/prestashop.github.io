Here is the latest report to inform you of what happened on the [PrestaShop translation project on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) in October. It's also an opportunity to highlight the work of PrestaShop's community of translators.

## Project news


### PrestaShop 1.7 is available!

As you might have heard, [PrestaShop 1.7 has been released](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-0-0-released/) earlier this month.
A special thanks to the translators who made it possible to release this version with **25+ languages already translated**, this is HUGE!

Of course the 1.6 remains open and you can still contribute to its translations (and if your language isn't completed in 1.7 nor in 1.6, better start with the 1.6 project!).

As PrestaShop 1.7 is now the latest available version, the figures for this monthly report will be based on the 1.7 project on Crowdin from now on.

Languages updates will take place every Monday for the time being, so for languages that aren't already 100% translated, you should expect some fresh new translations at the beginning of each week!

### 1.6 translations update

We are in the midst of updating language packs for 1.6, and it should be available by next Monday, November the 21st.
If not, you can send your complaints to our Core developer <a href="mailto:julien.bourdeau@prestashop.com">Julien Bourdeau</a>, he will be very happy to address it ;)

### Swahili, Tanzania

At the request of one of our merchants, we added the Swahili language, specific to Tanzania. If you need PrestaShop in this language, head over here to help us:

## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with September 2016, the following languages had the best progress in October thanks to the translation community:

(these numbers are mostly issued from the progress of the 1.7 project, as this is where most of the work took place this month.)

* **Nepali** (+100% to reach 2% translated in 1.7)
* **Arabic** (+7.5% to reach 43% translated in 1.7)
* **Croatian** (+2% to reach 100% translated in 1.6)

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

A lot has been going on there, so thanks to the proofreaders!

At the end of October, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* Arabic (43% translated vs 21% validated)
* Galician (68% vs 53%)
* Romanian (77% vs 62%)
* Czech (93% vs 79%)
* Finnish (100% vs 89%)


![October 2016 best translation progress](/assets/images/2016/11/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_Oct16.png)

Again, these figures are for 1.7, but 1.6 also need some proofreading too :)

As I'm writing this article, I'm very happy to let you know Turkish is now both fully translated AND validated, thanks to the huge work of the Turkish community, so it will no longer appear in this section! Hurray!

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread. We need your help!



If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we’ll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don’t hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

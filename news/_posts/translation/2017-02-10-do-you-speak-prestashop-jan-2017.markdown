You've probably been anxiously wondering what happened with the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) this month? Well, here is the first monthly report of 2017, just for you! :)

## Project news


### 1.7.1 is on its way

We're getting close to the upload of new strings for 1.7.1 version. We'll publish a short article here when it's done, to let you know what's new!


### Translations update

As usual, 1.7 translations are updated each Monday, and 1.6 translations every two weeks (or so ^^).

Last updates:

* 1.6 - Thursday, February the 10th

We're working at the moment on a system to automatically update translations each morning, we'll tell you when it's up and running!


Now let's get back to our Crowdin project, and the full report of its activity in January:

## Complete translations

#### Fully translated languages

At the end of January 2017, PrestaShop 1.6.1 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **17 languages**:

| Bulgarian | Croatian | Czech | Dutch |
| English | French | German | Indonesian |
| Italian | Lithuanian | Norwegian | Russian |
| Slovak | Slovenian | Spanish | Swedish |
| Turkish |


On its side, PrestaShop 1.7.0 is fully available in **20 languages**!

| Bulgarian | Croatian | Czech | Danish |
| Dutch | English | Estonian | French |
| German | Greek | Indonesian | Russian |
| Spanish |  Turkish | Slovak | Slovenian |
| Swedish | Turkish | Ukrainian |  Vietnamese |


Eight more languages are 100% translated but need a little bit of proofreading to be 100% fully validated and available.



## Languages with the best evolution

In comparison with December 2016, the following languages had the best progress thanks to the translation community:

* **Hindi** (+173% to reach 2% translated in 1.7)
* **Korean** (+25% to reach 15% translated in 1.7)
* **Romanian** (+7% to reach 88% translated in 1.7)
* **Catalan** (+5% to reach 100% translated in 1.7)

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the % of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of January 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Arabic** (55% translated vs 28% validated in 1.6)
* **Galician** (74% vs 52% in 1.6)
* **Catalan** (100% translated vs 82% validated in 1.7)
* **Portuguese**, Brazil (100% vs 85% in 1.7)
* **Finnish** (100% vs 85% in 1.6)

![Languages that need proofreading](/assets/images/2017/02/Build_Crowdin_proofreading_Jan17.png)

Again, these figures are for 1.7, but 1.6 also need some proofreading too :)

If you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please [contact me on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/alex-even) with the language you’d like to proofread. We need your help!

If you haven’t joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we’ll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

Do you have a question, a remark? Don’t hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

Thanks to all the contributors!

Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders

A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!

The list has quite evolved over the last few months, meaning that a lot of proofreading took place. It's great!

At the end of December 2017, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:

* **Bosnian** (73% translated vs 17% validated in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (80% vs 47% in 1.7).
* **Portuguese, Brazil** (100% vs 78% in 1.7).
* **Korean** (38% vs 17% in 1.7).
* **Arabic** (52% vs 37% in 1.7).

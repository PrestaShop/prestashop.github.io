## Project news


### Almost 30

We are slowly approaching the 30 fully completed projects. What an amazing job doing so far, be proud because you deserve it! Indeed, this daily joint effort allows us to make the community wider and closer to each need. We definitely passed the 25 available languages, for both 1.6 and 1.7 versions, so next step is naturally to reach 30. We are already the most international solution, compared to other softwares, and will stay as - business everywhere, without language barrier!


## A few stats
 
* **52 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **32,424 words have been translated** and **15,019 validated**.

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of April 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% translated vs 43% validated in 1.7).
* **Filipino** (80% vs 27% in 1.7).
* **Korean** (62% vs 27% in 1.7).
* **Galician** (95% vs 61% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (62% vs 32% in 1.7).

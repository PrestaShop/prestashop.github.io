Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in May.

## Project news


### 1.7.4 is on its way

You were waiting for it and the dream is coming true now: strings of the future minor version have entered the Crowdin catalog, everybody clap your hands! As you might already know, a new folder called 1.7.4 has been created in Crowdin, it contains the current strings and the fresh new ones, attached to the forthcoming 1.7.4 version of the software… that just expect you to be taken care of! So go for it, make your language back in the game by translating or approving the new wording. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of May 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Filipino** (80% translated vs 27% validated in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 58% in 1.7).
* **Korean** (70% vs 30% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Galician** (95% vs 61% in 1.7).

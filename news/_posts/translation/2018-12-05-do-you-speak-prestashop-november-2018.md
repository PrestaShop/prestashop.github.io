Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in November.

## Project news


### Our User Club is back in town

Yep, it is not a real translation-focused news but it is related to the translation community in a sense. Indeed, the PrestaShop [User Club]( https://www.prestashop.com/en/club) is back, available in eight languages, so we count on you to subscribe! It is a way for us to reach you out when we have questions or would like to get your feedback: we share feature surveys, mockups, designs, etc. It never takes too much time, and it really helps us to build a software that fits your needs!


## A few stats
 
* **53 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **65,536 words have been translated** and **72,330 validated**.
* All this in **11 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of November 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Galician** (100% translated vs 62% validated in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (51% vs 16% in 1.7).
* **Chinese Simplified** (98% vs 69% in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (52% vs 24% in 1.6).
* **Portuguese, Brazil** (98% vs 77% in 1.7).

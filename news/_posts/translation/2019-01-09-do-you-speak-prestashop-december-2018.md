Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in December.

## Project news


### Happy new year

2018 is over, guys, let’s welcome 2019 with more accurate translations, higher levels of completion and many beautiful projects to work on. Mostly, I wish you all to be happy. And in order to greet 2019 with interesting thoughts, I would like to share a nice initiative from the translation community: Victor Frankenstein's final report on the Arabic project. Read it, it is available [here](https://steemit.com/utopian-io/@dr-frankenstein/final-report-the-prestashop-project) and it will sure help you with your own translation work!


### Brazilian Portuguese is finally completed

After many months during which Brazilian Portuguese kept being translated by our wonderful team but lacked validation, I'm really happy to announce that it has finally reached 100%! It is great news as PrestaShop is growing more and more in Latin America (and therefore in Brazil), it means more merchants will benefit from a completely translated tool to run their business. Well done!


### PrestaShop turns global again

Because it needed big changes, the translation page of the PrestaShop was set offline those past few months. From then on, we decided to rework its components so that it can be simpler for people to grasp in one-click the translation rates they are looking for. And there is now a clear distinction between the back office (= the administration) and the front office (= the store). It needs to be improved though, we are still working on tiny details that should be fixed soon, but have a look at it [right here](https://www.prestashop.com/en/translations), and let us know what you think. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **54 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **53,978 words have been translated** and **31,489 validated**.
* All this in **15 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of December 2018, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Galician** (100% translated vs 62% validated in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 71% in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (52% vs 24% in 1.6).
* **Arabic** (98% vs 73% in 1.6).

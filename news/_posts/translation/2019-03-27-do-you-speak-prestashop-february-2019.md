Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in February.

## Project news


### Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the cinostroza, hairul123, Jaroslava, jpvapehiro, olcaykart, and santorosalvo. See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)


## A few stats
 
* **24 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **175,348 words have been translated** and **7,421 validated**.
* All this in **18 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of February 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Flemish** (100% translated vs 0% validated in 1.6).
* **Galician** (100% vs 62% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Chinese Simplified** (100% vs 71% in 1.7).
* **Tagalog** (52% vs 24% in 1.6).

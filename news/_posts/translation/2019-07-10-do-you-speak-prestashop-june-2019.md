Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in June.

## Project news


### Summer goodies

Before going on summer vacation, I’m glad to let you all know goodies are now being sent to the best translators – last session was in March. Go to your Crowdin profiles to check if you are among our top contributors for those last few months, we might need to send you a little something in order to thank you… and if you are, congratulations, it is time to have a look at your letterbox. ;-)


### Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated alexandre.beyonds, bkmcrowdin, half Rockstar (snfxgsx), Harlas, Jose Marfil (mescalitog), JossVans, lucasgomezortiz, Marvin Licup (marvinlicup25), Patricia Marie Anunciacion (pmcagamboa), Peeyush Agrawal (Peeyush), Petr Blaha (blahapetaand), and Tantely R. (rabtaray). See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of June 2019, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (100% translated vs 16% validated in 1.6).
* **Galician** (97% vs 61% in 1.7).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (53% vs 17% in 1.6).
* **Tagalog** (54% vs 24% in 1.6).
* **Chinese Simplified** (96% vs 69% in 1.7).

If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.

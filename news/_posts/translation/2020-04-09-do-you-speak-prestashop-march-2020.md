Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report tells you how the translations of the software evolved in March.

## Project news


### :calendar: PrestaShop Day Paris is postponed

In the current context related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak and its spread in Europe, the decision has been made to postpone PrestaShop Day Paris to a later date. It is a preventive measure aimed at preserving the health of all participants and all those involved in the organization of the event. We will let you know when a new date is set.


### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straightaway. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones that kind of rush into the effort immediately, aha! So lot of love to the dedicated ENNECIWEB (tredici900), Ilyasov Ivan (tRACE), Jeison M.B (jeison.martinez), jkosm, keeper7,MetinEREN, mirmal, mustafamodul, RamonMataro, robinbittner, and Rosvin John Rosales (rosvinrosales). See you soon on Crowdin… and PrestaShop. ;-)

Thanks to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it doesn't mean that the languages that aren't mentioned here aren't active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation wouldn't be modified (since it's working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of these proofreaders! Thank you too!
 
 
## Languages that need (more) proofreaders
 
A translated string will not be available in PrestaShop as long as it is not validated. For this reason, it’s important we should keep a good level of validated strings vs. translated strings, to make sure everyone benefits from the latest translations!
 
At the end of March 2020, some languages would still benefit from some proofreading:
 
* **Spanish, Argentina** (99% translated vs 13% validated).
* **Galician** (93% vs 59%).
* **Spanish, Venezuela** (46% vs 14%).
* **Arabic** (95% vs 71%).
* **Tagalog** (48% vs 25%).

If you haven't joined us on Crowdin yet, [it's never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)!
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let us know: we'll include a word about it in the next monthly report.
 
Do you have a question, a remark? Don't hesitate to leave a comment. See you next month!

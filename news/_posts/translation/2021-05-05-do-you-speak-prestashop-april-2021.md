Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in April!

## Project news

### :two_hearts: Special thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank the ones who rushed into the effort immediately! So lots of love to the dedicated [Vitor Rodrigues](https://crowdin.com/profile/mvitormrodrigues) and [SNor42](https://crowdin.com/profile/snor42) (who is also in the top translators this month! :tada:)

## A few stats
 
* **15 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **6,969 words have been translated** and **3,446 validated**.
* All this in **13 different languages**.
 
Thank you for your involvement!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting could be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since it is working on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

If you have not joined us on Crowdin yet, [it is never too late](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! :wink:
 
If you want to gather your fellow translators to work towards a better harmonization, start a glossary, or anything else, do let me know: I will include a word about it in the next monthly report.

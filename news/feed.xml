      <description>2,300 issues. One number. One challenge. Imagine searching for a needle in a haystack of 2,300 straws. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what PrestaShop contributors experience today when trying to check if their bug has already been reported. It&amp;rsquo;s also the daily challenge for our QA teams navigating this ocean of issues, some dating back to 2018.
This historical centralization in PrestaShop/PrestaShop made sense&amp;hellip; until it didn&amp;rsquo;t. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re changing course.
Our vision: every issue in its place, a place for every issue We&amp;rsquo;re opening issues directly in each repository that needs them (Core, Themes, Modules) so every repo tracks its own bugs.</description>

      <description>The PrestaShop cron service will be officially shut down in December 2025, marking the end of a legacy component that once helped stores without full server access automate scheduled tasks.
What is the PrestaShop cron service? This service was originally introduced to assist merchants on shared hosting environments that did not allow setting up native cron jobs. It worked together with the cronjobs module, sending periodic requests to execute scheduled actions such as currency rate updates or module maintenance routines.</description>

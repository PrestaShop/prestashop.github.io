      <description>Welcome to the August edition of Core Monthly. This month brought an important security patch for 8.2, a new community feature in the back office, and a fresh call for contributions to expand the Admin API in PrestaShop 9.
Security: PrestaShop 8.2.3 A security-driven patch release for PrestaShop 8.2 is out. Version 8.2.3 fixes an email enumeration vulnerability on the back office password reset page. While PrestaShop 9 is not affected, we strongly recommend updating if you are on the 8.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop 8.2.3 is available. It is a securityâ€‘driven patch release for the 8.2 branch. Its primary goal is to address an email enumeration vulnerability in the back office password reset feature. A handful of low-risk improvements and bug fixes that have already been validated have also been included.
Why this release now? PrestaShop 8.2 is in the extended support phase, so only security and critical fixes are shipped. Over the past days, we observed (via community reports and partners) automated probes abusing the back office password reset page to enumerate employee emails.</description>

      <description>From its very first release, PrestaShop has been built and improved thanks to the dedication of its open source community. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new way to celebrate that dedication - directly in your back office.
The Wall of Fame is a new tab in the back office available through the ps_distributionapiclient (version 1.2.0) module that showcases the top companies and individuals contributing to PrestaShop. Merchants can now see, right where they manage their store, the vibrant community making the software better every day.</description>

Why the Admin API? During FoP Days, we asked attendees to vote on future contribution topics. Three stood out: Hooks, Admin API, and Web Accessibility (EAA). We started with Hooks, work on the EAA subject will be part of Hummingbird 2, led by PrestaShop S.</description>

      <description>Now that PrestaShop 9.0 is out, here is a focus on maintained branches of the PrestaShop project and what to expect.
Reminder: PrestaShop branching strategy In August 2015 PrestaShop adopted a new branching model for the project.
The model was refined over the years, for example with this developer documentation page about which bugs qualify for a patch version or the Backward Compatibility Promise that defines which changes can be introduced in a version.</description>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary/</guid>
      <description>During this yearâ€™s FoP Days, we launched a new community initiative focused on improving a specific part of the PrestaShop project: hooks. Rather than casting a wide net, we deliberately concentrated on a single topic. The goal was to make it easier and faster for contributors to submit changes, and for project members to validate them.
Why hooks? Hooks are essential for extending and customizing PrestaShop without overriding core files. They empower developers to build features in a clean, future-proof way.</description>

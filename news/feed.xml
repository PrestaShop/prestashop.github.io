      <description>Now that PrestaShop 9.0 is out, here is a focus on maintained branches of the PrestaShop project and what to expect.
Reminder: PrestaShop branching strategy In August 2015 PrestaShop adopted a new branching model for the project.
The model was refined over the years, for example with this developer documentation page about which bugs qualify for a patch version or the Backward Compatibility Promise that defines which changes can be introduced in a version.</description>

      <title>Call for contributions: hooks - initiative summary</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary/</guid>
      <description>During this yearâ€™s FoP Days, we launched a new community initiative focused on improving a specific part of the PrestaShop project: hooks. Rather than casting a wide net, we deliberately concentrated on a single topic. The goal was to make it easier and faster for contributors to submit changes, and for project members to validate them.
Why hooks? Hooks are essential for extending and customizing PrestaShop without overriding core files. They empower developers to build features in a clean, future-proof way.</description>

      <title>Adapting to PrestaShop 9: Guzzle is gone, what&#39;s next?</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/breaking-change-guzzle-removal-v9/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/breaking-change-guzzle-removal-v9/</guid>
      <description>PrestaShop 9 is a major release, meaning it introduces breaking changes, including the removal of certain dependencies. One of the most impactful changes for module developers is the removal of Guzzle, a popular HTTP client that many modules relied on.
If your module depends on Guzzle, it will no longer be available by default in PrestaShop 9. In this article, weâ€™ll explain why Guzzle was removed, what this means for your module, and how to migrate to a suitable alternative.</description>

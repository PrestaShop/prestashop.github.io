We are excited to announce the release of PrestaShop 8.2.1, a new patch that not only addresses a significant number of bugs reported by our dedicated community and Quality Assurance team but also introduces a valuable new feature.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been decided to release a new minor version of PrestaShop 8.2. This version includes a few improvements, as well as bug fixes.
What&amp;rsquo;s new in PrestaShop 8.2? PrestaShop 8.2 is a minor version that includes a few improvements, as well as bug fixes, and it is relatively small compared to the previous minor versions. Here are some highlights.
Improvements Correctly checking overrides during module installation
PrestaShop used to check for overrides during module installation, but the process didnâ€™t fully block installation if a conflicting override was found.</description>

      <description>Now that PrestaShop 9.0 is out, here is a focus on maintained branches of the PrestaShop project and what to expect.
Reminder: PrestaShop branching strategy In August 2015 PrestaShop adopted a new branching model for the project.
The model was refined over the years, for example with this developer documentation page about which bugs qualify for a patch version or the Backward Compatibility Promise that defines which changes can be introduced in a version.</description>

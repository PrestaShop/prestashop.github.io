      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2026/introducing-shipments/</guid>
      <description>We are introducing a fundamental paradigm shift in PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s core: moving the order management center of gravity from the Carrier to the Shipment.
This major architectural change is already partially available for testing. Starting with PrestaShop 9.1, you can access these new features under a feature flag. This allows merchants, agencies and developers to start adapting to the new &amp;ldquo;Shipment&amp;rdquo; logic today, without disrupting existing stores.
Work in progress This feature is currently available for testing purposes.</description>

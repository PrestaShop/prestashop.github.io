          <title>Announcing end of support for obsolete PHP versions</title>

          <description> About a year and a half ago, we announced that PrestaShop 1.7.4.0 would be dropping support for PHP 5.4 and 5.5. At that time, this decision was justified by the impending end-of-maintenance for Symfony 2 and its replacement by Symfony 3, which didn’t support PHP versions older than 5.5.</description>

          <description>When working in a project as big and complex as PrestaShop, it’s easy to get too focused on what you are doing right now, and lose sight of the big picture. However, it’s very important not to do that, because every decision we take must be coherent with a bigger plan. In fact, I think that the only way to allow a project such as this to be sustainable, coherent and predictable, is to consistently challenge every decision in light of a long-term vision.</description>

          <description>Remember, back in May 2015, when we announced that we were building a new architecture for PrestaShop, with the first bits of code landing in version 1.6.1.0 (released in early July 2015)? Yeah, that was fun. But now that 1.7 is steaming ahead, it’s time to let you know about our updated plans about the new architecture…</description>

          <description>With the release of PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 we are going to introduce exciting new tools in the codebase that are designed to help write more modular, testable code that enforces separation of concerns.</description>

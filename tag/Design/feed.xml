          <description>During the second PrestaShop Developer Conference on November 6, 2024, I was able to introduce PUIK (PrestaShop UI Kit) to participants. This blog post provides a written summary of the presentation. During the talk, the audience gained a clearer understanding of PrestaShop’s UI Kit, based on the new PrestaShop Design System.

          <description>Contributing code to PrestaShop can be scary for first-timers, because not everyone knows how Git works. By the time you have figured how to properly push your changes to GitHub, the codebase has changed, rendering your suggestions impossible to merge – leading to frustration on both sides. It’s high time you learn about git rebase.</description>

          <title>Ten ways to improve your PrestaShop modules!</title>

          <description>PrestaShop has numerous features in the API, both hidden in its code as well as in the developer documentation and there are many tools that allow you to create your own module in no time! Unfortunately I have noticed that many developers do not use these features and tools to their advantage, so I think it’s time to change all that :) Hopefully, these tips will increase your development speed and save you lots and lots of time. And if not satisfied, you’ll get your money back! (Oh, wait…)</description>

The release of PrestaShop 9 provided the perfect opportunity for this update. The rebranding involved significant changes to the PrestaShop back office, focusing on its two themes.</description>

This led to a lot of inconsistencies. Wording is such an essential element of a good user experience, it was time for a change.</description>

          <description>Until now, PrestaShop always relied on a desktop-first responsive design strategy. Indeed, there are few use cases on mobile. But you can’t prevent users from checking their store’s back office on their mobile!</description>

          <description>We’ve been working on this project for a while now, and it is about time we tell you about the new module page we are planning for PrestaShop 1.7.0! Since September, our team (Thibaud, Thomas, Melvin, Guilhem, Léa and myself) has been busy redesigning the outdated module page of version 1.6. Needless to say, it is an important subject for PrestaShop’s business, but most importantly a key step in merchants’ journey to a successful online store.</description>

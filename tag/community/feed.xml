      <description>Let’s face it—our Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.
As part of the Seamless Upgrade &amp;amp; Extensibility squad, one of our key missions is to improve the reliability of PrestaShop upgrades. And to do that, we knew the Update Assistant module needed more than just a few patches—it needed a complete reinvention.</description>

      <description>As we continue to evolve and adapt to the global e-commerce landscape, we are implementing changes to streamline our operations and enhance our project’s trajectory. In 2022, we aimed to make PrestaShop a company-neutral open source project. Today, while keeping the project neutral, we are changing how we distribute the PrestaShop solution, starting with the upcoming 9.0 release.
One release, one Zip As you know, versions are distributed as two separate Zips, one on GitHub and a later one on prestashop.</description>

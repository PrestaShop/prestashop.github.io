      <description>PrestaShop 9 is a major release, meaning it introduces breaking changes, including the removal of certain dependencies. One of the most impactful changes for module developers is the removal of Guzzle, a popular HTTP client that many modules relied on.
If your module depends on Guzzle, it will no longer be available by default in PrestaShop 9. In this article, we‚Äôll explain why Guzzle was removed, what this means for your module, and how to migrate to a suitable alternative.</description>

      <description>Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîour Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.
As part of the Seamless Upgrade &amp;amp; Extensibility squad, one of our key missions is to improve the reliability of PrestaShop upgrades. And to do that, we knew the Update Assistant module needed more than just a few patches‚Äîit needed a complete reinvention.</description>

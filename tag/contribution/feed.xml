      <description>Two months ago, we launched our second Call for Contributions initiative, this time focusing on the Admin API. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to share the progress that&amp;rsquo;s been made!
What is this initiative about? Following the success of our first Call for Contributions focused on hooks, we asked the community during the FoP Days to vote on what to tackle next. The Admin API emerged as a top priority, alongside hooks and web accessibility.</description>

      <description>From its very first release, PrestaShop has been built and improved thanks to the dedication of its open source community. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re introducing a new way to celebrate that dedication - directly in your back office.
The Wall of Fame is a new tab in the back office available through the ps_distributionapiclient (version 1.2.0) module that showcases the top companies and individuals contributing to PrestaShop. Merchants can now see, right where they manage their store, the vibrant community making the software better every day.</description>

      <description>After the success of our first Call for Contributions focused on hooks, it&amp;rsquo;s time to launch a new round. This time, we&amp;rsquo;re inviting the community to contribute to one of the most significant changes in PrestaShop 9: the new Admin API.
Why the Admin API? During FoP Days, we asked attendees to vote on future contribution topics. Three stood out: Hooks, Admin API, and Web Accessibility (EAA). We started with Hooks, work on the EAA subject will be part of Hummingbird 2, led by PrestaShop S.</description>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/call-for-contributions-hooks-summary/</guid>
      <description>During this year’s FoP Days, we launched a new community initiative focused on improving a specific part of the PrestaShop project: hooks. Rather than casting a wide net, we deliberately concentrated on a single topic. The goal was to make it easier and faster for contributors to submit changes, and for project members to validate them.
Why hooks? Hooks are essential for extending and customizing PrestaShop without overriding core files. They empower developers to build features in a clean, future-proof way.</description>

      <title>Adapting to PrestaShop 9: Guzzle is gone, what&#39;s next?</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/breaking-change-guzzle-removal-v9/</link>

      <description>PrestaShop 9 is a major release, meaning it introduces breaking changes, including the removal of certain dependencies. One of the most impactful changes for module developers is the removal of Guzzle, a popular HTTP client that many modules relied on.
If your module depends on Guzzle, it will no longer be available by default in PrestaShop 9. In this article, we’ll explain why Guzzle was removed, what this means for your module, and how to migrate to a suitable alternative.</description>

      <title>Reworking the &#34;Update Assistant&#34; Module V7: Our Experience</title>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2025/reworking-the-update-assistant-module-v7-our-experience/</guid>
      <description>Let’s face it—our Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.
As part of the Seamless Upgrade &amp;amp; Extensibility squad, one of our key missions is to improve the reliability of PrestaShop upgrades. And to do that, we knew the Update Assistant module needed more than just a few patches—it needed a complete reinvention.</description>

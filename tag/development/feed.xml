          <description>Let’s face it—our Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.</description>

          <description>The develop branch contains the source code that will give birth to PrestaShop 9. This is the future of PrestaShop: it will be released either at the end of the year 2023 or at the beginning of the year 2024 and must carry on the ambition of the project for 2024. This major version must also embrace the change in the PHP ecosystem, and consequently, it must drop the support of obsolete PHP versions.</description>

          <title>Announcing end of support for obsolete PHP versions</title>
          <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2019/announcing-end-of-support-for-obsolete-php-versions/</link>

          <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2019/announcing-end-of-support-for-obsolete-php-versions/</guid>
          <description> About a year and a half ago, we announced that PrestaShop 1.7.4.0 would be dropping support for PHP 5.4 and 5.5. At that time, this decision was justified by the impending end-of-maintenance for Symfony 2 and its replacement by Symfony 3, which didn’t support PHP versions older than 5.5.</description>

          <description>After a Beta and a Release Candidate, the long awaited PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 has been released and is available for download. As usual, you can upgrade with the Auto upgrade module. However, considering that the current period is usually critical for merchants sales, for sure, some might prefer to wait for a more appropriate time :-)</description>

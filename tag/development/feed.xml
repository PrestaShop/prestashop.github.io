      <title>Reworking the &#34;Update Assistant&#34; Module V7: Our Experience</title>

      <description>Let’s face it—our Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.
As part of the Seamless Upgrade &amp;amp; Extensibility squad, one of our key missions is to improve the reliability of PrestaShop upgrades. And to do that, we knew the Update Assistant module needed more than just a few patches—it needed a complete reinvention.</description>

      <description>Here it is. The first public alpha of PrestaShop 9 is available. We decided it was time to share with you the first results of our work on PrestaShop 9.
Please note that this version is in the early stages of development. To achieve a stable release, we anticipate several months of further work. As we are prior to the feature-freeze phase, the features and content of PrestaShop 9 are subject to change.</description>

      <description>The develop branch contains the source code that will give birth to PrestaShop 9. This is the future of PrestaShop: it will be released either at the end of the year 2023 or at the beginning of the year 2024 and must carry on the ambition of the project for 2024. This major version must also embrace the change in the PHP ecosystem, and consequently, it must drop the support of obsolete PHP versions.</description>

      <title>Introducing TypeScript</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/introducing-typescript/</link>

      <description>Following a recent Architecture Decision Records (ADR) submission and a Proof of Concept (POC), the Core Maintainers team has decided to introduce TypeScript (TS) on the project.
Why TypeScript? During the last few years, the PrestaShop Project has been increasingly raising the code quality bar. To help maintainers ensure that quality keeps increasing, a number of automatic quality verification tools have been added to the CI pipeline:
ESLint analyzes the whole JavaScript codebase to ensure it follows our code style and find problems.</description>

      <title>Heads up: old development branches are going away</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/old-branches-are-going-away/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/old-branches-are-going-away/</guid>
      <description>The month of June is fast approaching, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a late Spring clean!
On June 1st, 2021 we will delete all branches from our main repository that are no longer subject to new releases.
The affected branches are:
1.7.0.x 1.7.1.x 1.7.2.x 1.7.3.x 1.7.4.x 1.7.5.x 1.7.6.x Future branches will be deleted as well once they will become stale (e.g. 1.7.7.x will be deleted shortly after 1.7.8 is out).
Important note: Please be aware that this is a routine cleanup and has absolutely no impact on source code availability for previous versions.</description>

      <description>Released almost 10 years ago, Composer is the most popular package manager for the PHP ecosystem. PrestaShop has been using it since 1.7.0 to manage its dependencies, including all the native modules.
Today we are announcing the general availability of PrestaShop itself through Composer. Thanks to this, it is now possible to easily create a new PrestaShop project from the command line, like this:
composer create-project prestashop/prestashop Or, if you want to download a specific version instead of the latest release:</description>

      <description>The project Core Web Vitals from Google has announced that loading time and performance will have an impact on the website ranking in search results. Google mentions lazy loading in their suggestions. Lazy loading will be available on Classic Theme in version 1.7.8 thanks to Progi1984 and it will definitely improve both user experience and loading time on your site!
What is lazy loading ? Lazy loading is a technique that defers loading of non-critical resources at page load time.</description>

      <description>This post is the first of a new kind. We decided to open up more with you about technical questioning and decisions for the PrestaShop project. This one is about generated asset files.
[EDIT] February 7th 2020: Considered the positive feedback we received after publishing the article, we decided to remove the generated files and to add the make assets command. Learn more in the devdoc.
Details of the feedback: 27 &amp;ldquo;Upvote&amp;rdquo; and 1 &amp;ldquo;Sad&amp;rdquo; reactions in Disqus.</description>

      <description>We are happy to announce PrestaShop 1.7.6.0 is officially available!
It has been quite a journey to deliver this huge release, our biggest yet since 1.7.1.0. Six months of development, a six week-long Beta, two Release Candidates&amp;hellip; Was it worth it? We absolutely think so, and hope that you will enjoy using it.
In this version we focused on improving and bringing back important 1.6 features to merchants, and kept working on code quality and performance improvements.</description>

      <description>That’s official, there will be a dedicated space for developers at the PSD Paris 2019. If you are developing themes and modules or contributing to the core, this is the place to be the 4th of June 2019.
Having such a place was expected by many people in the community. There was no dedicated space last year: that was possible to speak standing, exchange, but not possible to work. But this year, we do!</description>

      <description>Current PHP compatibility in PrestaShop You can check the current PHP compatibility of PrestaShop on our documentation. For PrestaShop 1.7 you can check this page. About a year and a half ago, we announced that PrestaShop 1.7.4.0 would be dropping support for PHP 5.4 and 5.5. At that time, this decision was justified by the impending end-of-maintenance for Symfony 2 and its replacement by Symfony 3, which didn&amp;rsquo;t support PHP versions older than 5.</description>

      <description>After a Beta and a Release Candidate, the long awaited PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 has been released and is available for download. As usual, you can upgrade with the Auto upgrade module. However, considering that the current period is usually critical for merchants sales, for sure, some might prefer to wait for a more appropriate time :-)
Changes A lot has been done to make this “minor” PrestaShop version a reality. Here’s 1.</description>

          <description>Contributing code to PrestaShop can be scary for first-timers, because not everyone knows how Git works.

It’s high time you learn about git rebase.</description>

          <description>As a serious developer, you need to use versioning (or “revision control”) for your projects, in order to track changes to your files… and be able to travel back in time when a disaster happens.

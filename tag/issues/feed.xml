      <title>A Fresh Start for PrestaShop Issues: Bringing Clarity to Chaos</title>

      <description>2,300 issues. One number. One challenge. Imagine searching for a needle in a haystack of 2,300 straws. That&amp;rsquo;s exactly what PrestaShop contributors experience today when trying to check if their bug has already been reported. It&amp;rsquo;s also the daily challenge for our QA teams navigating this ocean of issues, some dating back to 2018.
This historical centralization in PrestaShop/PrestaShop made sense&amp;hellip; until it didn&amp;rsquo;t. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re changing course.
Our vision: every issue in its place, a place for every issue We&amp;rsquo;re opening issues directly in each repository that needs them (Core, Themes, Modules) so every repo tracks its own bugs.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop is a successful Open Source project – with more than 300 000 shops worldwide, merchants trust us to help them build their ecommerce shop.
However this success has a cost: every day our users discover new bugs and inconsistencies in the project, and they come to GitHub to report them. On average, 10 new issues are created every day on GitHub (counting bug reports and feedback about features), and 2 out of 3 issues are either invalid or duplicates.</description>

      <description>Let’s face it—our Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.
As part of the Seamless Upgrade &amp;amp; Extensibility squad, one of our key missions is to improve the reliability of PrestaShop upgrades. And to do that, we knew the Update Assistant module needed more than just a few patches—it needed a complete reinvention.</description>

      <description>A recent wave of attacks has targeted PrestaShop stores, leveraging SQL Injection vulnerabilities in third-party modules to compromise data security. Malicious actors exploit these vulnerabilities to inject harmful code into the PrestaShop database, enabling the theft of sensitive customer information by loading unauthorized JavaScript scripts.
According to the investigation, this vulnerability is not in the PrestaShop core but in third-party modules. Stores using a custom database prefix and without SQL Injection-vulnerable modules installed should remain unaffected.</description>

      <description>It allows to authenticate the code of modules and to safely keep track of the sales data in the blockchain.
In the upcoming 1.7.3 version, we will release a new option for PrestaShop modules called PrestaTrust. This is one of the most innovative projects, based on a technology which is still to discover for a lot of people, a kind of mystery that makes great promises for the future of our world: the blockchain.</description>

      <description>Existing modules should mostly work as-is with version 1.7. In this article, we dive into that “mostly”!
As you certainly know, all well-written 1.6 modules should work with little to no changes in version 1.7, except:
Those which target the theme/front office – because we rewrote the way themes are written. Those which target the Product page – because the DOM of this page has changed. Those which target the Modules page – again, because the DOM of this page has changed.</description>

      <title>Presenting the Advanced EU Compliance module</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2015/advanced-eu-compliance/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2015/advanced-eu-compliance/</guid>
      <description>As good news never come alone, let us introduce you to the new module that is included natively in PrestaShop from 1.6.1.0 version: Advanced EU Compliance.
Why did we create this module? E-commerce evolves at a very fast pace, and the more it evolves the more new legislations are appearing to frame it. These legislations can - over time - become a real headache for e-shop owners, who have to adapt their website themselves, or to hire someone to do it for them.</description>

      <title>How to override modules in PrestaShop</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/howtos/module/how-to-override-modules/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/howtos/module/how-to-override-modules/</guid>
      <description>This article may be outdated Please note that this article refers to very old versions of PrestaShop. Check out the documentation to learn how to override modules. Since version 1.6.0.11 of PrestaShop, there is a new feature that allows developers to override a module&amp;rsquo;s instance classes (ie. its main module files, see the PR by @axometeam).
Since PrestaShop uses lots of modules for both core and custom features, module overrides are a welcome addition to an already great override system in PrestaShop.</description>

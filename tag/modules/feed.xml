          <description>Over the years, the PrestaShop project became host and maintainer for a very large number of open source modules. Last year, over 160 of them were present in our GitHub organization. As you probably know already, maintaining them requires a lot of work, and the maintainer team’s resources are limited. Proof of this is that some of these modules have not been updated in years.</description>

          <description>Early January, we encountered a security issue with PHPUnit in some modules that allowed attackers to perform arbitrary code execution without authorization through the PHPUnit dependency. This vulnerability was discovered through a merchant whose shops were compromised.</description>

          <description>Dear contributors, remember when, about two years ago, we presented you the Integration Fund? We even made an amazing video where we talk about this no less amazing Integration Fund. Well, we are still here and running, and for all this we would like to thank you.</description>

          <description>PrestaShop has been around for many years, during which thousands of modules were made by thousands of developers, yet we still see the same simple mistakes being made, even though they could easily be avoided.</description>

          <title>Ten ways to improve your PrestaShop modules!</title>

          <description>PrestaShop has numerous features in the API, both hidden in its code as well as in the developer documentation and there are many tools that allow you to create your own module in no time! Unfortunately I have noticed that many developers do not use these features and tools to their advantage, so I think it’s time to change all that :) Hopefully, these tips will increase your development speed and save you lots and lots of time. And if not satisfied, you’ll get your money back! (Oh, wait…)</description>

          <description>We’ve been working on this project for a while now, and it is about time we tell you about the new module page we are planning for PrestaShop 1.7.0! Since September, our team (Thibaud, Thomas, Melvin, Guilhem, Léa and myself) has been busy redesigning the outdated module page of version 1.6. Needless to say, it is an important subject for PrestaShop’s business, but most importantly a key step in merchants’ journey to a successful online store.</description>

          <description>One of the strengths of PrestaShop is how it reaches merchants all around the world through a highly customizable code, a high number of available languages and a rich catalog of local modules. We’re going a step further by making a big effort to offer local modules on PrestaShop Addons marketplace, thanks to the $1 million Integration Fund, launched in June, 2015.</description>

          <description>Let’s face it—our Update Assistant module was messy. The front-end was confusing, the user experience was challenging, and even minor adjustments were a little more complex than what we would have liked.</description>

          <description>For a few months, quality has been a priority for PrestaShop: the QA team and I are proud to announce that we’re making great steps in improving the overall quality of the core project. Automatizing tests is a big part of this process: let’s see what we’re doing, why, and how! Note: this article is focused on the Core only, but that is just a small part of what the QA team is working on. More to come in a future article!</description>

      <description>We are happy to announce the first release candidate of PrestaShop 8.1.
We&amp;rsquo;re on the brink of releasing the final 8.1 version. This time, the release candidate version is being shared simultaneously with the community and the project&amp;rsquo;s Quality Assurance (QA) team. The idea is for everyone to collectively confirm that all issues identified in the beta version have been resolved, ensuring their suitability for production use. If no major problems are reported by June 26th, we&amp;rsquo;ll move ahead and launch the final version of 8.</description>

      <title>Test PrestaShop 1.6.1.2 RC4</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2015/prestashop-1-6-1-2-rc4/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2015/prestashop-1-6-1-2-rc4/</guid>
      <description>Today we are releasing the fourth Release Candidate version of version 1.6.1.2.
Let&amp;rsquo;s be honest here: the RC2/RC3 was quite a mess, with last-minute issues which forced us to repackage the whole thing &amp;ndash; twice! Turns out several pull-requests were merged at the last minute in order to fix more issues in this version, and these PR were not as thoroughly tested as they should have been.
So this RC4 took a bit more time than usual, all the while featuring much less changes than the previous RCs: we took the time to revise our workflow, have more eyes look at the code before it was merged, and merged fewer PRs in order to keep the RC focused.</description>

      <description>We received quite a few feedback reports and pull-requests since we released v1.6.1.2 RC1 two weeks ago, so here&amp;rsquo;s the RC3, which fixes some more issues, and polishes a few more lines of code.
NOTE: The RC2 was first uploaded yesterday (Monday 5th) with a slight parenthesis issue which broke many pages. It was fixed by our Core team and repackaged at around 3 PM (Paris time), and two more small corrections since then have proven essential, hence the RC3.</description>

      <description>As mentionned in the previous Core Weekly report, the team is working on version 1.6.1.2, which after v1.6.1.1 is the second patch version of 1.6.1.0.
Like we did for v1.6.1.1, we want to give v1.6.1.2 a solid testing phase: we are planning two weeks for feedback on the issues that were fixed. This testing phase starts today, with the availability of the first Release Candidate version, or RC1 for short.</description>
